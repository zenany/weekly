**npm v5.0.0**
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500  
npm@5 takes npm a pretty big step forward, significantly improving its performance in almost all common situations, fixing a bunch of old errors due to the architecture, and just generally making it more robust and fault-tolerant. It comes with changes to make life easier for people doing monorepos, for users who want consistency/security guarantees, and brings semver support to git dependencies.

**The Architect Elevator — Visiting the upper floors**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/architect-elevator.html  
Traditionally, architects were considered to be those folks who make major design decisions on a project, draw architecture diagrams, and direct developers. Those tasks are in fact better handled by the development team and modern tooling than by a single person. Many modern companies therefore eschew software architect as a separate job title, even though they highly value software architecture. The good news is that many new tasks await architects in large organizations. And they are far more interesting and impactful than drawing class diagrams. However, they require architects to engage at the upper floors of their organization.

**A Roadmap to the Programmable World**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/iot-programmable-world-roadmap  
The emergence of millions of remotely programmable devices in our surroundings will pose significant challenges for software developers. A roadmap from today's cloud-centric, data-centric Internet of Things systems to the Programmable World highlights those challenges that haven't received enough attention.

**The state of JavaScript modules**  
https://medium.com/webpack/the-state-of-javascript-modules-4636d1774358  
In the following post, I will explain and summarize the current state of implementations and why I think that the transition to ES modules (ESM) will not harm the Node.js ecosystem. In the end, I will outline what these changes will mean for webpack users and module authors.

**V8, Advanced JavaScript, & the Next Performance Frontier**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdFDJANJJLs  
This talk will help developers write performant JavaScript, use new language constructs (ES2015+, async/await, etc.), and learn about the latest developments in modern benchmarking. We'll also demo DevTools asynchronous debugging features and new JavaScript code coverage tools.

**Pix2code - Generating Code from a Graphical User Interface Screenshot**  
https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code  
Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software, websites and mobile applications. In this paper, we show that Deep Learning techniques can be leveraged to automatically generate code given a graphical user interface screenshot as input. Our model is able to generate code targeting three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies) from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy.

**What is the Future of Front End Web Development?**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2017/05/22/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-javascript-bundlers/  
这是一个值得每个 Web 开发者思考的问题，这篇文章的观点挺值得参考的：State is the big concept; We're not building pages, we're building systems; The line between native and web is blurring; CSS preprocessing will slowly fade away...

**A Unified Styling Language**  
https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660  
In the past few years we’ve seen the rise of CSS-in-JS, emerging primarily from within the React community. This, of course, hasn’t been without its controversies. Many people, particularly those already intimately familiar with CSS, have looked on in disbelief. “Why would anyone want to write CSS in JS? Surely this is a terrible idea! If only they’d learn CSS!” If this was your reaction, then read on. We’re going to take a look at why writing your styles in JavaScript isn’t such a terrible idea after all, and why I think you should be keeping an eye on this rapidly evolving space.

**Chrome won**  
https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/  
前 Mozilla CTO 对浏览器发展的分析：Chrome is eating the browser market, and everyone else except Safari is getting obliterated. Does this mean Google owns the Web if they own Chrome? No. Absolutely not. Browsers are what the Web looked like in the first decades of the Internet. Mobile disrupted the Web, but the Web embraced mobile and at the heart of most apps beats a lot of JavaScript and HTTPS and REST these days. The future Web will look yet again completely different. Much will survive, and some parts of it will get disrupted. 

**IBM, Google and Lyft give microservices a ride on the Istio Service Mesh**  
https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/istio/  
IBM and Google announced the launch of [Istio](https://istio.io/), an open technology that provides a way for developers to seamlessly connect, manage and secure networks of different microservices—regardless of platform, source or vendor. 另附：[Enough with the microservices](https://aadrake.com/posts/2017-05-20-enough-with-the-microservices.html)、[Microservices made easy with Node.js](https://medium.com/@dashersw/microservices-made-easy-with-node-js-f41bb2be2d3c)

**Node.js Streams: Everything you need to know**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93  
Node.js streams have a reputation for being hard to work with, and even harder to understand. Well I’ve got good news for you — that’s no longer the case. Over the years, developers created lots of packages out there with the sole purpose of making working with streams easier. But in this article, I’m going to focus on the native Node.js stream API.

**The Roadmap for React: Fiber and Beyond**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW5TE4vrklU

**React vs Angular: Two Sides of JavaScript**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/react-vs-angular-two-sides-of-javascript-b850de22b413  
Bringing our knowledge together, we decided to shed some light on React vs Angular question and share some thoughts with you. Thus, in this article, we are going to transform our front-end development experience into something that will help you to determine the technology that fits you better.

**Rebuilding Slack’s Emoji Picker in React**  
https://slack.engineering/rebuilding-slacks-emoji-picker-in-react-bfbd8ce6fbfe  
We determined that the best way to introduce React would be to rebuild an existing product feature — that way, we could compare the development process and end result to a known quantity. We wanted a component that was interactive, self-contained, and demanding enough to prove our assumption that React could improve performance. It didn’t take long to find a perfect candidate — the highly used and surprisingly complex Emoji Picker.

**Why is Marko Fast?**  
https://medium.com/@psteeleidem/why-is-marko-fast-a20796cb8ae3  
Instead of focusing on benchmarks in this article, I want to focus on the details of optimizations that we have applied to Marko.

**Node.js cluster 踩坑小结**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27069865  
如果你要一个 common 的中规中矩的 LB 推荐用 nginx，如果你要比较好的均衡推荐用 HAproxy（不过不能像 nginx 那样处理静态文件），如果你要 LB 不差缓存比 nginx 好一点的可以用 Varnish（当然资源缓存最好用 CDN）。

**You might not need to transpile your JavaScript**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/you-might-not-need-to-transpile-your-javascript-4d5e0a438ca  
This post is not as wild as, say, YouMightNotNeedJS.com, but it does elaborate on transpilation, and explains why it may not be as necessary in the near future.

**Kill Google AMP before it KILLS the web**  
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad/   
In my view, don’t go far enough in stating the problem and I feel this needs to be said very clearly: Google's AMP is bad – bad in a potentially web-destroying way. Google AMP is bad news for how the web is built, it's bad news for publishers of credible online content, and it's bad news for consumers of that content. 另附：[What Google AMP means for the JavaScript community](https://molily.de/amp/).

**HTTPS on Stack Overflow: The End of a Long Road**  
https://nickcraver.com/blog/2017/05/22/https-on-stack-overflow/  
We deployed HTTPS by default on Stack Overflow. All traffic is now redirected to https:// and Google links will change over the next few weeks. The activation of this is quite literally flipping a switch (feature flag), but getting to that point has taken years of work. As of now, HTTPS is the default on all Q&A websites. We’ve been rolling it out across the Stack Exchange network for the past 2 months. Stack Overflow is the last site, and by far the largest. This is a huge milestone for us, but by no means the end. There’s still more work to do, which we’ll get to.

**View Counting at Reddit**  
https://redditblog.com/2017/05/24/view-counting-at-reddit/  
Vote score and number of comments were the main indicators of activity on a given post. We wanted to build a system that could capture this activity by counting the number of views a post received. This number is then shown to content creators and moderators to provide them better insight into the activity on specific posts. In this post, we’re going to talk about how we implemented counting at scale.

**Automation as a Service — Introducing Scriptflask**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/automation-as-a-service-introducing-scriptflask-17a8e4ad954b  
In our previous post, we spoke about building a common set of utilities — shell/python scripts that would communicate with each microservice in the netflix service ecosystem — which gave us an easy way to fetch data and make data assertions on any part of the data service pipeline. However, we began to hit the limits of our model much faster than we expected. In the following section, we talk about some of the obstacles we faced and how we developed a solution to overcome this.

**Writing a Really, Really Fast JSON Parser**
https://chadaustin.me/2017/05/writing-a-really-really-fast-json-parser/  
I used to think JSON parsing was not something you ever wanted in your application’s critical path. It’s certainly not the kind of algorithm that modern computers love (read byte, branch, read byte, branch). That said, this problem has been beaten to death. We now have multiple parsers that can parse data at hundreds of megabytes per second — around the same rate as SHA-256! If we relaxed some of the constraints on sajson, it could even go faster.

**Best Practices for Long Scrolling**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/best-practices-for-long-scrolling/  
Long scrolling can create a completely immersive browsing experience. If users like a UI and find it intuitive, then they won’t really mind the length of the scrolling. Thus, focus on their goals and make things more convenient for your users.

**Stack Overflow: Helping One Million Developers Exit Vim**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/  
In the five years since this question was asked, there have been over a million other developers who got stuck in Vim and couldn’t escape without a bit of help. In honor of this milestone, we decided to take a look at the data surrounding this question. In particular, we’ll try measuring who is most likely to get stuck in Vim as opposed to using it intentionally, and examining how that balance varies by country and by programming language.

作为千禧一代，我们会出于直觉和本能发现目标。仅仅发现目标还不够，我们这代人面临的挑战，是创造一个人人都能有使命感的世界。使命感使我们意识到我们身上有比自己更重要的东西，我们是被需要的，我们要为之加倍努力。使命感能创造真正的快乐。创造一个每个人都有使命感的世界的三种方法：一起做有意义的项目；通过重新定义平等，使每个人都有追求目标的自由；在全世界建立社群。
