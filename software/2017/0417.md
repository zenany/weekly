## 深阅读

**Real-world JavaScript performance**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2017/04/real-world-javascript-performance.html  
Over the course of the past year, the V8 team has developed a new method for measuring performance against snapshots of real web pages. Using insights from real-world measurements, the V8 team improved the speed of the average page load in Chrome by 10-20% over the course of the past year. 另附：[V8 - Retiring Octane](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/04/retiring-octane.html)、[Chrome - Scroll anchoring for web developers](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/04/scroll-anchoring-for-web-developers.html).

**PhantomJS - Stepping down as maintainer**  
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phantomjs/9aI5d-LDuNE  
[Headless Chrome is coming](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5678767817097216). I think people will switch to it, eventually. Chrome is faster and more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesn't eat memory like crazy. I don't see any future in developing PhantomJS. Developing PhantomJS 2 and 2.5 as a single developer is a bloody hell.

**TypeScript at Slack**  
https://slack.engineering/typescript-at-slack-a81307fa288d#1  
At Slack, we strive to be good open-source citizens. To that end, we strive to make the move to TypeScript easier for other developers: Whenever we find gaps, we try to close them. 另：[TypeScript 2.3 已经 发布 RC 版了](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2017/04/10/announcing-typescript-2-3-rc/).

**How we built Twitter Lite**  
https://blog.twitter.com/2017/how-we-built-twitter-lite

**Creating a Modern OCR Pipeline Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/04/creating-a-modern-ocr-pipeline-using-computer-vision-and-deep-learning/  
In this post we will take you behind the scenes on how we built a state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline for our mobile document scanner. We used computer vision and deep learning advances such as bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs), Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), convolutional neural nets (CNNs), and more. In addition, we will also dive deep into what it took to actually make our OCR pipeline production-ready at Dropbox scale.

**The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a CTO**  
https://brainhub.eu/guide-to-becoming-a-cto  
Becoming a CTO is really hard. There is nothing more valuable than a real experience, but in addition to the experience, you can find a ton of useful resources over the internet to help you get started. Therefore we've put together an amazing list of (recommended by other CTOs) resources (blog posts, books, presentations, videos etc.). The reason why we're doing this is to help you to become a better CTO/Technical Leader in your startup or company.

**The Post JavaScript Apocalypse - Douglas Crockford**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPB34lDZj3E  
This is about JavaScript, clutter, purity, and thoughts on what should be in the language that comes after, assuming that we all live that long.

**So what’s this GraphQL thing I keep hearing about?**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-whats-this-graphql-thing-i-keep-hearing-about-baf4d36c20cf  
GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics: It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs; It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources; It uses a type system to describe data. So how did GraphQL get started? What does it look like in practice? And how do you start using it? Read on to find out!

**ECharts GL 1.0 alpha 发布**  
http://echarts.baidu.com/blog/2017/04/12/echarts-gl-alpha.html  
距离 ECharts-X 最近一个版本已经过去了两年多时间，期间我们不断被开发者在各种渠道询问 ECharts-X 为什么还不升级新版本，是不是不再维护了等等，对于这些问题我们只能回答我们还没准备好。尽管这两年时间 ECharts X 没什么动静，但是其它的工作，像 ECharts 3 的架构大改动和后续版本的迭代升级，以及其它 WebGL 产品的开发，都是对新版本架构和技术上的积累。现在我们终于可以说我们准备得差不多了，ECharts-X 的下一代，ECharts-GL 发布 1.0 alpha。

**上帝说：要有一门面向未来的语言，于是有了 erlang**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NDM0ODQwMw==&mid=2649827691&idx=1&sn=8d6854f91bb9d16470ef6eed9d3ad8ec  
这篇文章对 erlang 的介绍挺有意思的，尤其是 erlang 的设计哲学，很多都可以当做系统设计原则来用。

**如何处理好前后端分离的 API 问题**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652974908&idx=1&sn=cc0fd32fba8602c6cf26d42e0ee3ff3f  
API 的维护是一件烦人的事，所以最好能一次设计好 API。可是这是不可能的，API 在其的生命周期里，应该是要不断地演进的。它与精益创业的思想是相似的，当一个 API 不合适现有场景时，应该对这个 API 进行更新，以满足需求。也因此，API 本身是面向变化的，问题是这种变化是双向的、单向的、联动的？还是静默的？API 设计是一个非常大的话题，这里我们只讨论：演进、设计及维护

**文本数据可视化 - 从 Wordle 谈起**  
http://geekplux.com/2017/04/12/text-data-visualization-wordle.html  
大到宣传海报，小到个人名片，Wordle 如今随处可见。它可以轻松的展示出一段文字的关键词，让我们对这段话的内容一目了然。\本文就从最简单的 Wordle 说起，说说文本内容可视化，以窥数据可视化一隅。

**The Psychology of Speed**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/the-psychology-of-speed/  
Why do people leave a website? There could be many reasons, such difficulty finding what they are looking for. But there’s a good chance users leave a site because it feels too slow to load. In this section, I want to draw some attention to psychology, and how it plays a big role in our perception of speed and performance.

**How We Track Pageviews Is All Wrong**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/how-we-track-pageviews-is-all-wrong/  
The reality is the web has changed a lot in the last 10-15 years, and more and more websites don’t fit this traditional model. Our analytics tools haven’t kept up. Analytics tools should measure user engagement, and they shouldn’t be coupled to site implementation. When the user experience improves, we should be able to prove it via our analytics reports. This is the most straightforward way to make the business case for progress.

**A Comprehensive Guide To HTTP/2 Server Push**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/guide-http2-server-push/  
In this article, you’ll learn all about server push, from how it works to the problems it solves. You’ll also learn how to use it, how to tell if it’s working, and its impact on performance. Let’s begin!

**How we made our DNS stack 3x faster**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-made-our-dns-stack-3x-faster/  
Cloudflare is now well into its 6th year and providing authoritative DNS has been a core part of infrastructure from the start. Last year we decided to replace two core elements of our DNS infrastructure: the part of our DNS server that answers authoritative queries and the data pipeline which takes changes made by our customers to DNS records and distributes them to our edge machines across the globe. The rough architecture of the system can be seen above.

**Debugging Tips and Tricks**  
https://css-tricks.com/debugging-tips-tricks/  
I have a few tips and tricks I rely on pretty heavily and found that I give the same advice again and again during workshops, so here's a compilation of some of them, as well as some from the community. We'll start with some core tenets and then drill down to more specific examples.

**Mastering the Node.js CLI & Command Line Options**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/mastering-the-node-js-cli-command-line-options/  
Node.js comes with a lot of CLI options to expose built-in debugging & to modify how V8, the JavaScript engine works. In this post, we have collected the most important CLI commands to help you become more productive.

**V8 plan for Node.js LTS Carbon (A potential path to TurboFan + Ignition)**  
https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/99  
V8 5.9 will be the first version with TurboFan + Ignition (TF+I) turned on by default. As parts of the Node.js codebase have been tuned to CrankShaft, there will be a non trivial amount of churn to adapt to the new pipeline. This also creates a security risk as CrankShaft and FullCodeGen are no longer maintained by the V8 team or tested by the Chrome security team.

**Textbook manifesto**  
http://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/  
My textbook manifesto is so simple it sounds stupid. Here it is: Students should read and understand textbooks. That’s it.  It’s hard to imagine that anyone would disagree, but here’s the part I find infuriating: the vast majority of textbook authors, publishers, professors, and students behave as if they do not expect students to read or understand textbooks.

**在阿里讲了5小时运营后，我想试着重新解读“运营”**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NDUyOTAwOA==&mid=2652915417&idx=2&sn=b7358b4c98f7cb3f20ce8970a315c82b  
在整个互联网业内，当谈及到“运营”时，我们的理解仍然是模糊、混乱和高度不清晰的。且，这个状况，不仅对于运营从业者们无益，甚至某种程度上，对于行业的发展都已经带来了一些阻碍。我们或许需要一个对于“运营”的全新解释。它应该打破此前“内容运营、用户运营、活动运营”这一类的僵硬框架，应该足够简洁清晰，也应该能够让诸多运营从业者对于自己在做的事情不再充满疑惑。
