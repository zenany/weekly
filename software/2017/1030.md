**V8 Release 6.3**  
https://v8project.blogspot.ca/2017/10/v8-release-63.html  
V8 version 6.3, which is in beta until its release in coordination with Chrome 63 Stable in several weeks. V8 v6.3 is filled with all sorts of developer-facing goodies. This post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release.附：[V8 Today and in the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rx9fSUG8H0).

**Introducing the Chrome User Experience Report**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2017/10/introducing-chrome-user-experience-report.html  
We’re making the [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/) available to encourage performance and user experience improvements across the web.
The report is a public dataset of key user experience metrics for top origins on the web. The initial release includes data from a sample of ten thousand origins and focuses on loading metrics, though we hope to expand coverage in future iterations. 

**Can You Afford It?: Real-world Web Performance Budgets**  
https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/  
Performance budgets are an essential but under-appreciated part of product success and team health. Most partners we work with are not aware of the real-world operating environment and make inappropriate technology choices as a result. We set a budget in time of <= 5 seconds first-load Time-to-Interactive and <= 2s for subsequent loads. We constrain ourselves to a real-world baseline device + network configuration to measure progress. The default global baseline is a ~$200 Android device on a 400Kbps link with a 400ms round-trip-time (“RTT”). This translates into a budget of ~130-170KB of critical-path resources, depending on composition — the more JS you include, the smaller the bundle must be.

**Coding with Clarity**  
https://alistapart.com/article/coding-with-clarity  
Working code isn’t necessarily good code. Your code also needs to be easy to read, understand, and modify. It needs clarity, and to achieve that, it has to be organized well, with careful planning and proper separation of ideas taking place before you even open your code editor. Coding for clarity is something that separates the great developers from the merely good, and there are a few basic principles that can set you on that path.

**The QUIC transport protocol: design and Internet-scale deployment**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/10/26/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/  
QUIC is a transport protocol designed from the ground up by Google improve the performance of HTTPS traffic. The chances are you’ve already used it – QUIC is deployed in Chrome, in the YouTube mobile app, and in the Google Search app on Android. It’s also used at Google’s front-end servers, handling billions of requests a day. All told, about 7% of global Internet traffic is now flowing over QUIC. There are three interesting aspects to the paper, that we can essentially divide into the Why, the What, and the How. How QUIC was built and evolved over time is an integral part of the story.

**The Web Fundamentals Gap**  
https://zendev.com/2017/10/24/the-web-fundamentals-gap.html  
There are no shortage of boot camps, courses, and resources to learn front-end development out there, but having interviewed a lot of the folks coming out of these boot camps, I think there is a serious under-appreciation of the importance of CSS and the fundamentals of JavaScript.

**小米直达服务介绍与开发实战**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwNjQwMzUwMQ==&mid=2247485534&idx=1&sn=5e2bb37df32a89db8bc0be825d6768c4  
直达服务平台上的各个服务采用前端技术栈开发，但是并不跑在浏览器或 WebView 中，它舍弃了浏览器内核渲染，转而采用 Android 的原生渲染机制，也就是说，实际上是使用前端技术栈开发了一个原生应用，无论是渲染效率，还是系统能力的 API 丰富程度，都远远超出传统网页。

**EggBorn.js：一款顶级Javascript全栈开发框架**  
https://cnodejs.org/topic/59eebce1f8d374775c0157d7#59eed0621bbf067d5c3fa7cd  
EggBorn.js是采用Javascript进行全栈开发的最佳实践。EggBorn.js不重复造轮子，而是采用业界最新的开源技术，进行全栈开发的最佳组合。EggBorn.js前端采用Vue.js + Framework7 / Vue Router + Webpack，后端采用Koa.js + Egg.js，数据库采用mysql。

**[译]构建Uber端到端技术栈的十条经验**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwMzg1ODcwMw==&mid=2247487005&idx=1&sn=eb24f50840ebe3f3e5c67f46dcea558d  
我在 Uber 这几年，做了很多系统稳定性及可扩展性的工作，也做了一些移动开发的工作，因此我对 Uber 端到端的技术栈还比较熟悉。在这里以我的经历为例跟大家分享一下如何快速地做一个稳定的端到端大型应用。

**从架构理解价值**  
http://www.jianshu.com/p/6ebf289d0e05  
所以软件架构不仅仅只是选用什么框架、选用什么技术组件这么简单。它贯穿了对人的组织、对技术的组织、对业务的组织，并将这三种组织以解决业务问题这一目标有机的结合在了一起。

**忘掉技术债，创造技术财**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NTU2MTg3MQ==&mid=2655161735&idx=1&sn=4426d3d7717d874a22827d8a5533b423  
这个理念蛮不错的。Andrea Goulet 是 Corgibytes 的 CEO ，这家咨询公司主要承担应用的重构和现代化等项目。她曾经见识过各种各样破旧的系统、遗留的代码以及繁重的技术债，感觉人们都在以数字化的方式囤积各种“古董”。因此 Goulet 认为初创公司需要转变自己的心态，不要斥资积累技术债，而是要创造技术财；不应继续用老旧的代码将就，而应特意进行重构。她将通过本文介绍自己提出的新方法，以及将不可能变为可能的做法。

**React 16 Release: What’s New?**  
https://auth0.com/blog/whats-new-in-react16/  
In this article, we'll highlight notable additions to ReactJS 16 and dabble into the architecture it runs on.

**HTML Web Component using Vanilla JavaScript**  
https://ayushgp.github.io/html-web-components-using-vanilla-js/  
Web Components have been around for a while now. Google has really been trying to push for their more widespread adoption, but most major browsers still have very little support for it, except for Opera and Chrome. However, by using polyfills, available from https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills, you can build your own Web Components now. In this article, I’m going to teach you how to create your own HTML tags with styles, functionality, and markup neatly packaged in their own files.

**Stop Designing For Only 85% Of Users: Nailing Accessibility In Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/nailing-accessibility-design/  
The visual interface is an obvious place to begin digging into accessibility. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the most common visual impairments, focusing on color-blindness to explain how you can make small changes to your workflow and products to ensure you’re not alienating users.

**A Guide to Automating & Scraping the Web with JavaScript**

**Building Smart Replies for Member Messages**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/10/building-smart-replies-for-member-messages  
At LinkedIn Messaging, we are working hard to bring value to our members by providing innovative improvements to the way they communicate professionally with others. Today, we are introducing a brand new natural language processing (NLP) recommendation engine that provides members with smart reply recommendations. In this blog post, we discuss the process we went through to build the models and infrastructure that power smart replies for members.

**Why does one NGINX worker take all the load?**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/  
Balancing the incoming connections across multiple application workers is far from a solved problem. The single queue approach (b) scales well and keeps the max latency in check, but due to the epoll LIFO behavior the worker processes won't be evenly load balanced. The best generic solution seem to be to change the standard epoll behavior from LIFO to FIFO.

**What's going on with containers? Here's a helpful glossary**  
https://coreos.com/blog/software-container-terminology-glossary  
Containers bring additional security, isolation, and simplified app delivery to the classic model. At CoreOS, we see container standards and components as a function of three major categories: cluster operations, node operations, and software delivery. Each of these categories has inputs and outputs that link it to the others. Check out the [Software Container Terminology Glossary](https://resources.coreos.com/white-papers/software-container-terminology-glossary) for a comprehensive list of defined standards and components in each of the three categories above. 另附：[

**用《清单革命》让复杂工作变简单**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NjgzMzkwMQ==&mid=2653646406&idx=1&sn=9fc89b68138045f882a1f5dd04afbef4  
所谓的创新，其实没那么天外飞仙，也不是靠灵感，情怀或者勤奋，本质是靠你对一件事情或方法的反复推演和严格执行。这也是《清单革命》最有价值的佐证。清单就是把干好一件事情的原则和关键点都写下来，保证曾经成功过的方法和结果能大概率地可复现。所谓清单方法论，就是选定自己关键的清单，严格按照这个清单执行，再根据结果去修改清单。这个过程中，最重要的两个字就是——严格。如果光有清单，不严格执行，一定会出问题。即便做创意性或创造性的工作，其实也需要有自己的清单。

内心不渴望的东西，它不可能靠近自己。不惜一切，努力创造世人公认的“尽善尽美”的产品，这对于以创造为目标的人来说是非常重要的，甚至是一种义务。想要成就某项事业，就必须成为能够自我燃烧的人。要成为“自燃型”的人，在热爱自己工作的同时，必须持有明确的目标。
