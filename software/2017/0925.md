**The Ten Essentials for Good API Documentation**  
https://alistapart.com/article/the-ten-essentials-for-good-api-documentation  
API documentation is the number one reference for anyone implementing your API, and it can profoundly influence the developer experience. Because it describes what services an application programming interface offers and how to use those services, your documentation will inevitably create an impression about your product—for better or for worse. 另附：[PayPal - API Style Guide and Patterns: The Evolutionary Journey Continues](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2017/09/08/announcing-the-latest-api-style-guide/)

The era of Framework churn is coming to an end, and now we can all go back to working on what makes our apps unique instead of spending precious time, energy, and money jumping to something new every year.

**It’s time to kill the web**  
https://blog.plan99.net/its-time-to-kill-the-web-974a9fe80c89  
The web has grown so fat that calling it open is now pretty meaningless: you have no chance of implementing HTML5 unless you have a few billion dollars you’d like to burn. The W3C didn’t meet its users needs and is now irrelevant, so unless you work at Google or Microsoft you can’t meaningfully impact the technical direction of the web. Some of the competing platforms that were once closed opened up. And the JavaScript ecosystem is imploding under the weight of its own pointless churn.

**腾讯主要创办人张志东 (Tony)：谈谈互联网产品的老化**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/222538  
好产品是在一个历史时期，比较优雅地解决一个社会的痛点。做一个好产品很难，但开始偏离或者老化，却是很容易。第一种：自我中心的膨胀。第二种：KPI 的变形。该如何避免企业老化？第一，敬畏感，特别是创始人的敬畏感；第二，可以说真话的文化；第三，要有能发光的带头人；第四，组织再造。在互联网的行业和高科技行业，过去的成绩，容易成为未来的负担。企业在顺境时，能否有合适的机制和文化，能否保持对未来的敬畏，能否保持对产品独特价值的敏感度，也许是特别值得大家思考的地方。
