**API Design Guide**  
https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/  
This is a general design guide for networked APIs. It has been used inside Google since 2014 and is the guide we follow when designing Cloud APIs and other Google APIs. It is shared here to inform outside developers and to make it easier for us all to work together. 另附：[10 Best Practices for Writing Node.js REST APIs](https://blog.risingstack.com/10-best-practices-for-writing-node-js-rest-apis/)、[API Design: Think First, Code Later](https://www.ckl.io/blog/api-design-think-first-code-later/)

**V8 is going to switch to a new compiler architecture after 5.8 branch cut**  
https://groups.google.com/forum/?#!msg/v8-dev/YXpjhVeHlbI/iiYlrF8vCgAJ  
The V8 team is currently working on a new compiler pipeline that will help us bring future speedups to real-world JavaScript. In the next few weeks we will replace our current compiler architecture based on a non-optimizing (FullCodeGen) and optimizing compiler (Crankshaft) pair with the combination of an interpreter (Ignition) and a new optimizing compiler ([TurboFan](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/TurboFan)).

**Node 6 at Wikimedia: Stability and substantial memory savings**  
https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/02/17/node-6-wikimedia/  
Over the last years, Wikimedia engineers have built significant Node.js services to complement the venerable MediaWiki wiki platform implemented in PHP.  Over 10 such services are deployed in our production environment, powering features like VisualEditor, scientific formulae rendering, rich maps display and the REST content API. Individual services are built and owned by specific teams on top of the overall Node.js platform, which is maintained by the Wikimedia Services team. Recently, we upgraded our infrastructure to Node.js v6. This blog post describes how we did it, and what we learned in the process.

**The Future of Serverless Compute**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/future-serverless  
As we approach the end of the early-adopter period, it’s an interesting exercise to put on our prediction goggles and contemplate where this movement is going next, how it’s getting there, and most importantly what changes we need from our organizations to support it. So, join me as we look at one possible future of Serverless compute.

**Web 持续集成工作实践**  
http://div.io/topic/1929  
2015年10月我加入一家已盈利的创业公司，负责 Web 技术方向。创业过程中为了生存，都是拼快拼狠，难免选用猛糙快的工作方法。随着业务和团队不断扩大，面对的问题也越来越具挑战性。我逐步将一些自动化工具和方法引入到日常工作中，使团队获得一些收益。本文总结我这一年来做持续集成的获得经验教训。持续集成，项目之大事，研发团队负责人不可不察也。持续集成是通过平台串联各个开发环节，实现和沉淀工作自动化的方法。

**Front-End Developer Handbook 2017**  
https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook-2017/details  
This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2017.The content of the handbook favors web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these open technologies. The materials referenced and discussed in the book are either best in class or the current offering to a problem.

**Announcing the first SHA1 collision**  
https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html  
Today, more than 20 years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, we are announcing the first practical technique for generating a collision. This represents the culmination of two years of research that sprung from a collaboration between the CWI Institute in Amsterdam and Google. We’ve summarized how we went about generating a collision below. As a proof of the attack, we are releasing two PDFs that have identical SHA-1 hashes but different content. 附：[Linus' reply on Git and SHA-1 collision](http://marc.info/?l=git&m=148787047422954)、[Mozila - The end of SHA-1 on the Public Web](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/02/23/the-end-of-sha-1-on-the-public-web/)、

**Code review checklist**  
https://ana-balica.github.io/2017/02/21/code-review-checklist/  
Over the last couple of months, I’ve developed my own internal code review checklist. I use it both for reviewing for own finished code and my teammates code complete tickets. It’s split up into 3 sections: code, automated testing and manual testing.

**A Detailed Introduction To Webpack**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/a-detailed-introduction-to-webpack/  
JavaScript module bundling has been around for a while. RequireJS had its first commits in 2009, then Browserify made its debut, and since then several other bundlers have spawned across the Internet. Among that group, webpack has jumped out as one of the best. If you’re not familiar with it, I hope this article will get you started with this powerful tool.

**Node.js - Quality with Speed**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/community/quality-with-speed/  
One of the key tenets of the Node.js community is to allow change at a rapid pace in order to foster innovation and to allow Node.js to be used in a growing number of use cases. At the same time the community values quality. Newer versions of the runtime must be as good or better than earlier versions and must not un-intentionally break existing applications. Instead of trading off one for the other, the community looks for the path that allows us to maintain our rate of change while ensuring the required level of quality. Many of the activities undertaken by the community over the last year are in support of this goal. This is our take on how these activities fit together.

**Deep dive CSS: font metrics, line-height and vertical-align**  
http://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align  
Line-height and vertical-align are simple CSS properties. So simple that most of us are convinced to fully understand how they work and how to use them. But it’s not. They really are complex, maybe the hardest ones, as they have a major role in the creation of one of the less-known feature of CSS: inline formatting context.

**Big Data Visualization with Meaning**  
https://alistapart.com/article/big-data-visualization-with-meaning  
As with all design, the approach we take when creating a user-minded visualization is based on the context and the constraints we have to work with. Good data visualizations—those with meaning—need to be accessible and human even though data is rarely described with those words.

**8 Best Practices for Mobile Form Design**  
http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/02/8-best-practices-for-mobile-form-design.php  
Designers have now been building mobile forms for a decade. But, as technology continues to go through metamorphoses and our understanding of users’ needs becomes more refined, good mobile form design is constantly evolving.

**3 Key Uses for Animation in Mobile UI Design**  
https://uxplanet.org/3-key-uses-for-animation-in-mobile-ui-design-4d7c482dd84b#.q4mobfh1y  
With the quick development of technology, animation is less of a visual luxury and more of a functional requirement that users expect. Animation solves a lot of functional problems within interfaces and makes interfaces feel alive and truly responsive to the user. Let’s explore the key animation tactics that improve the functionality and emotional power of your mobile interface.

**What Does Being a Fullstack Developer Mean in 2017?**  
https://blog.qmo.io/what-does-being-a-fullstack-developer-mean-in-2017/  
What does fullstack mean? Everyone has their own definition. The problem is the breadth and depth of technologies have expanded so rapidly, fullstack developers are trying to play catch-up when everything is already red‑shifted by the time you're looking at it. This problem is what makes "fullstack" a contested and controversial title.

互联网时代的中国，城市与乡村，白领与蓝领，二元对立又相互依赖。面对这样一个复杂而庞大的市场，该如何做产品推广？知名创业者、前腾讯资深产品经理梁宁在读完《创京东》之后，给出了自己的看法——当你要推一个产品的时候，是不是可以更直率地想，目标是京东的1万白领，还是11万蓝领？

**为什么网易系擅长做产品**  
http://tech.qq.com/a/20170223/026608.htm  
由谙熟业务，比高层更年轻，更懂用户市场的中层来掌握做产品的实权。几乎没有KPI文化，产品做得好与坏，主要靠产品经理的内心热情来驱动，不靠金钱驱动，更不会为了完成数字而打乱节奏。没有产品大战略，不参与刚正面的烧钱竞争，网易的产品策略只能以中小投入为主，不去赤裸裸地拼资源，便格外注重创新与体验。

你可能见过很多关于微信公众号排版的教程，告诉你应该用多少字号、用什么颜色、行距应该设置为多少，大部分教程或许对想速成或直接找一个 todolist 做工作交差的人来说，是有效的。然而，真正要做好排版，并不只是需要获得别人给的 todolist，而是理解排版背后的原理。
