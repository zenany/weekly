**Bringing collaborative editing to any application**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/Bringing-collaborative-editing-to-any-application/  
Three years ago, we decided to face the challenge of making real-time, multi-user collaborative writing available for every software out there. That idea kicked off the development of CKEditor 5 and many other solutions now known as the CKEditor Ecosystem. In this article I give a quick overview of the problem we aim to solve, the solutions we developed for that purpose and how to approach collaborative editing in your application.

**面向未来的前端数据流框架 - dob**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30664158  
dob 是利用 proxy 实现的数据依赖追踪工具，利用 dob-react 与 react 结合。dob 的核心思想大量借鉴了 mobx，但是从实现原理、使用便捷性，以及调试工具都做了大量优化。同时 dob 借鉴了 nx-js/observer-util 思想，但这个库仅仅停留在理论层面，实际使用中细节问题百出，dob 对其实现原理进行大幅修复，通过了多次实战考验。

**前端框架新选择——基于MVVM的San**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650998840&idx=1&sn=81f16c1a82c53a31c076c1c2d526e66d  
为了让几乎所有希望引入 MVVM 的 Web 前端业务场景在做技术选型的时，可以没有顾虑，百度 EFE TEAM 历时接近两年时间设计、开发 San 框架，一个实现了 MVVM 的 Web 组件化框架。在接近两年的时间里，它不断迭代，支撑了越来越多的业务。

**从Chrome源码看浏览器如何加载资源**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30558018  
对浏览器加载资源有很多不确定性，例如：css/font的资源的优化级会比img高，资源的优化级是怎么确定的呢？资源优先级又是如何影响加载的先后顺序的？有几种情况可能会导致资源被阻止加载？通过源码可以找到答案。此次源码解读基于Chromium 64。

**腾讯QQ空间超分辨率技术TSR：为用户节省3/4流量，处理效果和速度超谷歌RAISR**  
https://www.leiphone.com/news/201710/c0GICjRacVyzHKIM.html  
TSR技术在同样的标准下，处理速度在RAISR的基础上提升了40%，处理效果也有明显提升。此外，TSR也是业界首次实现移动端使用深度神经网络进行超分辨率，并保证图片能够实时进行处理。即使在用户的普通Andriod手机，也可以使用这项技术。

Orchid combines its protocol with surplus bandwidth, state-of-the art-encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure to bring users surveillance-free access to the existing Internet. Because everyone is surveilled and bandwidth is ubiquitous, Orchid users can exchange bandwidth in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Ending the debate on inline functions in React**  
https://flexport.engineering/ending-the-debate-on-inline-functions-in-react-8c03fabd144

**Migrating Slack’s Desktop App to BrowserView**  
https://slack.engineering/growing-pains-migrating-slacks-desktop-app-to-browserview-2759690d9c7b  
We rewrote most of our Electron app to move from the janky webview to the new-fangled BrowserView. We managed to do it in a relatively short timeframe, thanks to a combination of elbow grease and reasonable choices in our client stack, like: Redux + redux-electron; Rx + redux-observable; TypeScript: Helps us refactor code quickly and correctly.

**How We Identify and Stop Slow Latency Leaks at LinkedIn**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/10/fixing-the-plumbing--how-we-identify-and-stop-slow-latency-leaks  
At LinkedIn, we pay attention to site speed at every step of the release process, from code development to production ramp. But inevitably, the performance of our pages degrades over time (we use the word “pages” to denote webpages as well as mobile apps). In this post, we go over the tools and processes we use to catch and fix these degradations. While this is a post about automation to identify latency leaks, it is also a tale of how a human touch is still necessary.

**Web Typography: Designing Tables to be Read, Not Looked At**  
https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables  
Good designers spend a great deal of time sweating over typography. They agonise over typefaces, iterate through type scales and meticulously apply white space, all in the service of the reader. Then comes along a table with the temptation to get creative, and all thoughts of the reader go out of the window. And yet tables are there to be read, referenced and used, not merely looked at.

**Sketching Interfaces - Generating code from low fidelity wireframes**  
https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/  
The time required to test an idea should be zero. This was the very first sentence I wrote when considering the Airbnb design tools team vision. We believe that, within the next few years, emerging technology will allow teams to design new products in an expressive and intuitive way, while simultaneously eliminating hurdles from the product development process. Our team has begun exploring methods to bring testing time to zero. As we learn and build, we will be sharing what we’re working on here.

**10 UX Design Predictions For 2018**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/  
We’re living in a time when design and user experience have never mattered more. The past decade of change shows us that design must constantly adapt as a discipline in order to meet user needs.While it’s impossible to see the future, we can still make some educated guesses about it. In this article, I go through some of the trends that will shape UX design in 2018 and, possibly, for several more years to come. 另附：[9 Principles of Mobile Web Design](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/9-mobile-web-design-principles)

“以客（用）户为中心”、“客户是上帝”之类的说法早已成为普遍的共识。与不少勿庸置疑的共识一样，这些说法细究起来是颇成问题的。热衷于“吸粉”的企业很容易忽略粉丝与粉丝间的巨大差异，很容易在不加分别地“善待客户”中，严重亏待真正为企业创造价值的客户，不知不觉地让企业的经营方向被无效客户牵引到雷区。
