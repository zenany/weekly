**复杂单页应用的数据层设计**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/24677176  
飞叔新作，结合一些典型场景探讨了 Web 应用数据层的可行实现方式，对做单页应用非常有帮助。

**编写「可读」代码的实践**  
http://taobaofed.org/blog/2017/01/05/writing-readable-code/  
编写可读的代码，对于以代码谋生的程序员而言，是一件极为重要的事。从某种角度来说，代码最重要的功能是能够被阅读，其次才是能够被正确执行。一段无法正确执行的代码，也许会使项目延期几天，但它造成的危害只是暂时和轻微的，毕竟这种代码无法通过测试并影响最终的产品；但是，一段能够正确执行，但缺乏条理、难以阅读的代码，它造成的危害却是深远和广泛的：这种代码会提高产品后续迭代和维护的成本，影响产品的稳定，破坏团队的团结（雾），除非我们花费数倍于编写这段代码的时间和精力，来消除它对项目造成的负面影响。

**The PRPL Pattern**  
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/  
PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), with an emphasis on the performance of app delivery and launch. It stands for:
- Push critical resources for the initial URL route.
- Render initial route.
- Pre-cache remaining routes.
- Lazy-load and create remaining routes on demand.

**Idiomatic Redux: Thoughts on Thunks, Sagas, Abstraction, and Reusability**  
http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/01/idiomatic-redux-thoughts-on-thunks-sagas-abstraction-and-reusability/  
The redux-thunk and redux-saga libraries are the most widely-used libraries for "side effects" in Redux. There's been a lot of recent statements arguing that thunks (and sagas) are bad and should almost never be used. As a result, I've seen developers confused and wondering what alternatives they have to implement a given feature. The concerns being raised are valid, but to balance the discussion, I would argue that thunks are a useful tool in Redux applications, and that developers should not be scared to use thunks in their codebase. 作者的 [Idiomatic Redux](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/idiomatic-redux/) 系列文章挺不错的。

**Clean Code concepts adapted for JavaScript**  
https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript  
Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book Clean Code, adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript. Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even less will be universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of Clean Code.

**Algorithm-Driven Design: How Artificial Intelligence Is Changing Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/algorithm-driven-design-how-artificial-intelligence-changing-design/  
This is a story of a beautiful future, but we should remember the limits of algorithms — they’re built on rules defined by humans, even if the rules are being supercharged now with machine learning. The power of the designer is that they can make and break rules; so, in a year from now, we might define “beautiful” as something totally different. Our industry has both high- and low-skilled designers, and it will be easy for algorithms to replace the latter.

**The memory models that underlie programming languages**  
http://canonical.org/~kragen/memory-models/  
There are about six major conceptualizations of memory, which I’m calling “memory models”², that dominate today’s programming. These models shape what our programming languages can or cannot do at a much deeper layer than mere syntax or even type systems. Mysteriously, I’ve never seen a good explanation of them — you pretty much just have to absorb them by osmosis instead of having them explained to you — and so I’m going to try now. Then I’m going to explain some possible alternatives to the mainstream options and why they might be interesting.

**How Difficult Can It Be to Integrate Software Development Tools**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/tool-integration-hard-truth  
An unintegrated software development and delivery toolchain creates bottlenecks, drains productivity, impedes collaboration and inhibits project visibility. Integration of the toolchain may seem like a straight forward undertaking, but it is much more difficult than it appears initially.

**React’s Five Fingers of Death. Master these five concepts, then master React**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-5-things-you-need-to-know-to-understand-react-a1dbd5d114a3#.icq5xllzf  
Now don’t get me wrong, this doesn’t mean I can turn you into a React master instantly. But at least you’ll understand all the major concepts, if you do decide to jump in. The five key concepts are: Components、JSX、Props & State、The Component API、Component Types.  

**How I converted my React app to VanillaJS**  
https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff#.8ghr0bw0i  
This little exercise started as a React replacement project, but quickly turned into a React appreciation project. I’m quite sure that if I hadn’t been peeking over the shoulder of React, my efforts would have been a white hot mess. Frameworks will often be doing a bit of extra work that you could avoid if you wrote the code yourself, this is true. But on the whole, I think this is a fair tradeoff for the improved productivity that comes with using a well-written framework that encourages some great practices.

**Authoring and publishing JavaScript modules with Flow**  
http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2017/01/npm-flowjs-javascript/  
I hope this blog post gives you a look into the world of writing typed JavaScript with Flow. In terms of the type system itself this blog post barely touches the power of Flow, and it’s something I’ll be writing more about as I get more comfortable with it and learn more. If you’re a library author I’d encourage you to try writing in Flow, it’s a great experience whilst developing a library and can help prevent bugs.

**How to ask good questions**  
https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/  
Asking good questions is a super important skill when writing software. I’ve gotten way better at it over the years (to the extent that it’s something my coworkers comment on a lot). Here are a few guidelines that have worked well for me!

For the past several years, Mozilla’s been working on a brand new, top-secret engine. Except it's totally not top-secret. Never was. At another company it would have been a top-secret project. At Mozilla, it's all done out in the open. The project is called [Servo](https://servo.org/). It was started as an experiment. It's coded in a new programming language called Rust. Servo is a modern, high-performance browser engine designed for both application and embedded use.

**关于约束、掌控、选择与自由**

世界上存在两类人。一类人叫做约束者，永远面临的是无尽的任务与约束；另一类人叫做选择者，他们面前则总是无限的选择与自由。约束者要去完成一件事，动机往往是“不得不做”。选择者要去完成一件事，都是为了“让自己感觉更好”。
