**Let's Dev: A Package Manager**  
https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/07/11/lets-dev-a-package-manager/  
Hello everyone! Today, we’re gonna write a new package manager, even better than Yarn! Ok, maybe not, but at least we’re gonna have some fun, learn how package managers work, and think about what could come next on Yarn.

**ES8 was Released and here are its Main New Features**  
https://hackernoon.com/es8-was-released-and-here-are-its-main-new-features-ee9c394adf66  
EcmaScript 8 or EcmaScript 2017 was officially released at the end of June by TC39. It seems that we are talking a lot about EcmaScript in the last year. It’s not for nothing. Currently the standard is to publish a new ES specification version once a year. ES6 was published in 2015 and ES7 was published in 2016, but did someone remembered when ES5 was released? It happened in 2009, before the magical rise of JavaScript. 另附：[Pattern Matching in ECMAScript](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/pattern-matching-in-ecmascript)

**Security updates for all active release lines**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2017-security-releases/  
Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines as well as the 7.x line. These include the fix for the high severity vulnerability identified in the initial announcement, one additional lower priority Node.js vulnerability in the 4.x release line, as well as some lower priority fixes for Node.js dependencies across the current release lines.

**Introducing npx: an npm package runner**  
https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b  
[npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx) is a tool intended to help round out the experience of using packages from the npm registry — the same way npm makes it super easy to install and manage dependencies hosted on the registry, npx makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry. 另：[npm v5.3.0](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/162986246605/v530-2017-07-13)

**Upcoming RegExp Features**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/07/upcoming-regexp-features.html  
ES2015 introduced many new features to the JavaScript language, including significant improvements to the regular expression syntax with the Unicode (/u) and sticky (/y) flags. In this blog post we want to give you a preview of this exciting future. If you'd like to follow along with the upcoming examples, enable experimental JavaScript features at chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony.

**Introducing sphinx-js, a better way to document large JavaScript projects**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/introducing-sphinx-js-a-better-way-to-document-large-javascript-projects/  
sphinx-js consumes standard JSDoc comments and tags—you don’t have to do anything weird to your source code. You just have Sphinx initialize a docs folder in the root of your project, activate sphinx-js as a plugin, and then write docs to your heart’s content using simple reStructuredText. When it comes time to call in some extracted documentation, you use one of sphinx-js’s special directives, modeled after the Python-centric autodoc’s mature example.

**The MVC Design Pattern in Vanilla JavaScript**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/mvc-design-pattern-javascript/  
The MVC pattern is good for client-side frameworks, but modern frameworks change. What is modern today is subject to the passing of time and withers away. In this take, I’d like to explore alternatives and see where a little discipline takes us.

**Event Delegation: Pattern or Anti-Pattern**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/07/11/event-delegation-pattern-or-anti-pattern/  
Event delegation is one of the defacto ways of doing event handling. But is it the right methodology for all projects? In fact, the better question might be whether the assumptions each toolkit has made are right for your project. Knowing whether an API is right for your project depends on knowing what assumptions these tools are built on and understanding how each toolkit has interpreted them.

https://onevcat.com/2017/07/state-based-viewcontroller/  
在这篇文章里，我会先实现一个很常见的 MVC 架构，然后对状态和状态改变的部分进行抽象及重构，最终得到一个纯函数式的易于测试的 View Controller 类。希望通过这个例子，能够给你在日常维护 View Controller 的工作中带来一些启示或者帮助。

**Developer Experience Lessons Operating a Serverless-like Platform At Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/developer-experience-lessons-operating-a-serverless-like-platform-at-netflix-a8bbd5b899a0  
This is the first in a series of posts where we draw from our learnings to outline various aspects that we are addressing in the next generation of our platform. We believe these aspects are applicable to general purpose serverless solutions too. Here we will look at application development, delivery and code composition. Future posts will delve into topics such as deployments, insights, performance, scalability and other operational concerns.

**How Rust is tested**  
https://brson.github.io/2017/07/10/how-rust-is-tested  
I’ve always admired well-tested software projects, like SQLite, and aim to place Rust among the pantheon of the best. This document then, is a catalog of all the ways we test Rust. I hope it provides insight into what it takes to deliver a production-quality programming language, a hint at the wide variety of techniques employed in software validation, and that it reinforces your confidence in Rust’s reliability. 另附：[Principles of Automated Testing](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/PrinciplesofAutomatedTesting.html)

**Mock system APIs**  
https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/mock-system-apis/  
When you write your module (let's say a Node JavaScript one), you often expose public API, but internally your code accesses the outside world via own code. Testing the public API is the best, but often it is hard, since your code interacts with the file system, user or network. How do you test the exposed API when you need to mock the rest of the system? I think it is preferable to NOT mock your own code modules, but to mock the interface to the external world.

**Don’t write an SPA* Unless it makes sense to**  
https://blog.semanticscholar.org/dont-write-an-spa-57aaa40e0314  
SPAs are a good choice if: The interface you’re building is highly interactive and needs to be fast / responsive — and you want an architecture and abstractions that supports this out the gate; You’re not worried about each and every bit of content being indexed by search engines correctly. On the other hand, an SPA might not be worth the complexity if: Your application is simple (there’s not a lot of interactive content); SEO is of pivotal importance.

**What is “modern” programming**  
http://lemire.me/blog/2017/07/15/what-is-modern-programming/  
I submit to you that modern programming has little to do with the look of your desktop. Graphical user interfaces are only skin deep. Modern programming techniques are all about processes and actual tools, not the skin on top of them. I don’t care whether you are using Eclipse or Emacs… this tells me nothing about how modern you are. So what is “modern”?

For better readability, I’ve combined the deliverables according to UX activities: User Research, Market Research, Design, Testing. For each item in the list you’ll find additional links or video with detailed explanation or best practices.

**URLs are UI**  
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/URLsAreUI.aspx  
So many folks spend time on their CSS and their UX/UI but still come up with URLs that are at best, comically long, and at worst, user hostile.

**emotion - The Next Generation of CSS-in-JS**  
https://github.com/tkh44/emotion  
emotion is a high performance, lightweight css-in-js library. The core idea comes from Sunil Pai’s glam library and its philosophy is laid out here. The basic idea is simple. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice runtime performance for good developer experience when writing CSS. emotion minimizes the runtime cost of css-in-js dramatically by parsing your styles with PostCSS during compilation instead of at runtime. 详见[介绍文](https://medium.com/@tkh44/emotion-ad1c45c6d28b)。

在企业类应用服务（SaaS）、检测工具（手机安全助手）、量化自我工具（智能手环）等后台管理系统中，使用Dashboard可以帮助用户监控和分析数据，快速获取重要信息。但如果对Dashboard设计缺乏认知，就很可能会造成Dashboard呈现的信息杂乱，充斥着无关紧要的指标、文本信息及各种半成品的图表等，让用户抓不到重点。那么，设计师该如何设计内容精确、体验友好的Dashboard以满足用户需求呢？

技术连接了两个端，一端是需求、目的，另一端是一个已有的技术，将两者结合一起，商业贡献与技术贡献的有效结合形成化学反应，出现了一个新技术，而这个新技术再去满足新的技术，再出来一个新的技术，形成一个化学反应过程。如果团队成员每个人想法背景多元化，但梦想又相同时，会出现很多创新的结果，技术本身是化学反应不是物理反应。比团队认同自己更重要的是，认同共同的目标。最顺利的时候总是最危险的时候。今天很残酷，明天更残酷，但是后天很美好。

我们一定要有一个坚定不移的深刻的理念，相信整个世界终究是为技术所驱动的；有没有其他人已经解决这个问题？然后你可以把你的时间放在更好的创新上；做什么事情一定要做最好，一定要是做业界最强的；我把自己想象是一个软件、一个代码，今天的版本一定要比昨天版本好，明天的版本肯定会比今天好；看到问题也不要去问别人，就把它Fix。
