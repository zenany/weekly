**Better Software Design with Clean Architecture**  
https://fullstackmark.com/post/11/better-software-design-with-clean-architecture  
Clean Architecture provides a simple and effective framework for separating the different aspects of our system producing a highly decoupled, testable architecture. Like most design decisions there are tradeoffs to be made when considering Clean Architecture. I hope this guide has provided some insight on how Clean Architecture can improve your software design and prevent many of the common pitfalls that hinder projects. Like any pattern, it takes a little familiarity with the concepts and principles before they can be effectively applied.

**React, Relay and GraphQL: Under the Hood of the Times Website Redesign**  
https://open.nytimes.com/react-relay-and-graphql-under-the-hood-of-the-times-website-redesign-22fb62ea9764  
The New York Times website is changing, and the technology we use to run it is changing too. As the new site rolls out over the next several months, a look under the hood will reveal a number of modern technologies designed to make the site faster and easier to use — for readers, most importantly, but also for our developers. At the center of this has been our adoption of React, Relay and GraphQL.

**Under the hood: ReactJS**  
https://bogdan-lyashenko.github.io/Under-the-hood-ReactJS/  
This repository contains an explanation of inner work of ReactJS. In fact, I was debugging through the entire code base and put all the logic on visual block-schemes, analyzed them, summarized and explained main concepts and approaches. I’ve already finished with Stack version and now I work with the next, Fiber version.

**Web Frameworks: Foundational Technologies**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/07/06/web-frameworksfoundational-technologies/  
In this post we’ll look at how the different web frameworks deal with the fundamentals. We’ll look at what environments are supported, how well aligned they are to the current standards, how they future proof their code, and how they go above and beyond the current standards. This analysis will give us an indication of what sort of foundations we are building on when leveraging a particular framework. Especially in the enterprise, web frameworks are not just nice Christmas gifts. Using the first one we unwrap will affect our applications for a long time.

**Chat Bots and the Future of Web Development**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/chat-bots-and-the-future-of-web-development/  
There are currently more than 100,000 bots and developers on the Messenger network alone. More than 10,000 businesses are already using or working on their own bots, and by 2020 80% businesses hope to have chatbots for interacting with customers. In this article, I’ll cover what chatbots are, the sudden boom in their popularity, how they are significantly changing the way we browse and interact with the web, why web developers and designers should care about this paradigm shift, and what they can specifically do to keep up.

**A set of best practices for JavaScript projects**  
https://github.com/wearehive/project-guidelines

分布式系统用多个设备来处理特定问题，但是如何保证这样的处理结果像单机系统那样正确？这里的正确指的是：以相同的顺序进行相同的一系列操作，分布式系统能得到和单机系统相同的结果。本文主要介绍了分布式系统中 Linearizability 概念，以及它与 Serializability 的区别，并介绍了 Spanner 中是如何通过 TrueTime 来实现 Linearizability。

**如何掌握所有的程序语言**  
http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2017/07/06/master-pl  
对的，我这里要讲的不是如何掌握一种程序语言，而是所有的……很多编程初学者至今还在给我写信请教，问我该学习什么程序语言，怎么学习。由于我知道如何掌握“所有”的程序语言，总是感觉这种该学“一种”什么语言的问题比较低级，所以一直没来得及回复他们 :P 可是逐渐的，我发现原来不只是小白们有这个问题，就连美国大公司的很多资深工程师，其实也没搞明白。

**MySQL infrastructure testing automation at GitHub**
https://githubengineering.com/mysql-testing-automation-at-github/  
Our MySQL infrastructure is a critical component to GitHub. MySQL serves GitHub.com, GitHub’s API, authentication and more. Every git request touches MySQL in some way. We are tasked with keeping the data available, and maintaining its integrity. We have the infrastructure to automate away such operations; in this post we share a few examples of how we build trust in our infrastructure through continuous testing. It is essentially how we sleep well at night.

**Democratizing Experimentation Data for Product Innovations**  
https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2017/06/29/democratizing-experimentation-data-for-product-innovations/  
A/B Testing (also known as experimentation or bucket testing), enables the product teams to gain more insights and understandings of PayPal users, their behavior and interaction with PayPal product pages, product flows and products in general (with user permissions).  It is critical to arrive to some product decisions fast in a data driven manner, and hence facilitates fast iterations and turn-arounds to speed up innovations and product development cycles.

**Where do Type Systems Come From?**  
http://blog.felipe.rs/2017/07/07/where-do-type-systems-come-from/  
In short, type theory was developed to be an alternative to set theory as the foundation of mathematical proofs in symbolic logic due to its ability to solve some contradictions stemming from naive set theory.

**The Many Problems with Jenkins and Continuous Delivery**  
https://thenewstack.io/many-problems-jenkins-continuous-delivery/  
Ultimately, the root of these problems stems not from specific tools, but from cultural mistakes. Problem 1: Jenkins has too many plugins. Problem 2: Jenkins was not designed for the Docker age. Problem 3: Jenkins does not support microservices well. Problem 4: CI != CD. 

**The Options for Programmatically Documenting CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/options-programmatically-documenting-css/

**Designing The Perfect Date And Time Picker**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/designing-perfect-date-time-picker/  
What could be so difficult about designing a decent date picker? Basically, we just need an input field and an icon that represents a calendar clearly enough, and once the user clicks on that icon, we pop up a little overlay with the days lined up in rows. Right?

**Looking at the future of responsive design**  
https://www.mercurytide.co.uk/blog/article/looking-future-responsive-design/  
Responsive web design is the design methodology of making a singular website ‘respond’ to the size of the viewport it is being presented in, allowing users to view your website from any device big or small and have it look as well presented as it does on a desktop computer. From humble beginnings responsive design has evolved gradually over the years, it has taken many different forms as standards and support for modern technologies have improved and the requirement for a way to cater to an increasingly mobile obsessed populace has become more crucial. This whitepaper focuses on the technologies that have emerged to tackle this issue and where they are going.

**ECMAScript Pattern Matching Syntax**  
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching/blob/master/README.md  
Pattern matching is a way to select behaviors based on the structure of a value in a similar way to destructuring. For example, you can trivially match objects with certain properties and bind the values of those properties in the match leg. Pattern matching enables very terse and highly readable functional patterns and is found in a number of languages. This proposal draws heavy inspiration from Rust and F#. This proposal is stage 0 and as such is open to significant revision.

**我看绩效考核**  
http://coolshell.cn/articles/17972.html  
制定目标和绩效，目的不是用来考核人的，而用来改善提高组织和人员业绩和效率的。人是复杂的，人是有状态波动的，任何时候都不应该轻易否定人，绩效考核应该考核的是事情，而不是人。我个人比较坚持的认为——绩效分应该打给项目，打给产品，打给部门，打给代码，而不是打给人。
