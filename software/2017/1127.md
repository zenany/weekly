**Clojure Design Patterns**  
http://mishadoff.com/blog/clojure-design-patterns/  
Disclaimer: Most patterns are easy to implement because we use dynamic typing, functional programming and, of course, Clojure. Some of them look wrong and ugly. It’s okay. All characters are fake, coincidences are accidental.

**PWA是否能带来新一轮大前端技术洗牌**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwNjQwMzUwMQ==&mid=2247485600&idx=1&sn=12e229c90cc08e8f14dcc1ae7f27abd6  
对于 Native App 来说，其 最大的痛点是由于其天生封闭的基因，内容无法被索引，这会导致后续一系列的问题。而随着移动互联网的发展，用户下载 App 的热情也逐渐减弱，再加上用户 80% 的时间被 Top3 的超级 App 占据，对于站点来说，应用分发成本也因此越来越高了。相对于 Native App 的封闭，PWA 却是完全开放的——PWA 现有的所有技术都是遵循 W3C 的标准，完全开放，因此能够快速被站点接受、被浏览器快速支持。值得一提的是，为了解开传统 Web 的两个枷锁，除 PWA 之外，业界也诞生了很多技术方案，例如部分厂商推出的小程序技术。

**为什么原生应用开发者需要关注Flutter？**

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzOTU0NTQ0MA==&mid=2247486388&idx=1&sn=f55b4ecd8402e0fa1a7587fb4af5f7c5  
智能化运维的终极目标，就是将运维人员从繁琐的工作中解放出来，提高整体运维效率，降低运维成本，实现业务系统的高可用性。目前业界真正的智能化运维的落地实践其实并不多，大多还是停留在自动化甚至人工化阶段，然而智能化运维是大势所趋。阿里又是如何应对呢？下面请看来自阿里巴巴研发效能团队负责人、阿里研究员毕玄的演讲《智能时代的新运维》。

**The Performance Cost of Server Side Rendered React on Node.js**  
https://malloc.fi/performance-cost-of-server-side-rendered-react-node-js

https://css-tricks.com/save-15-car-insurance-switching-plain-javascript/

**腾讯的方法论：如何创造一个好产品，以及如何进化成一家好公司？**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/224230  
优秀的产品人，应该有自信去做更好的价值挖掘，尝试建立不伤害用户体验的、更为优雅的商业模式。「真正的好产品，团队内部是不需要 CEO 或团队管理者来「打鸡血」的」，每个成员都可以感受到它的魅力，与旧产品的体验有巨大差别。好产品能让团队自然兴奋，自己就能感受到创造的快乐，感受到工作的美好。反而，如果只是靠企业管理的压强、靠 KPI 的压力驱动，或许就不是很好的产品，或者产品已经开始老化。另附：[对话「ThinkPad 之父」内藤在正，解读品牌背后的坚守与创新](http://www.geekpark.net/news/224102)
