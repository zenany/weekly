**Announcing Guetzli: A New Open Source JPEG Encoder**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-guetzli-new-open-source-jpeg.html  
At Google, we care about giving users the best possible online experience, both through our own services and products and by contributing new tools and industry standards for use by the online community. That’s why we’re excited to announce Guetzli, a new open source algorithm that creates high quality JPEG images with file sizes 35% smaller than currently available methods, enabling webmasters to create webpages that can load faster and use even less data. [译文](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5Nzc4OTA1Mw==&mid=2659599074&idx=1&sn=a26ae2a8becdc1f2cfbddf44d8ca1495)。

**Three challenges for the web, according to its inventor**  
http://webfoundation.org/2017/03/web-turns-28-letter/  
Today marks 28 years since I submitted my original proposal for the worldwide web. But over the past 12 months, I’ve become increasingly worried about three new trends, which I believe we must tackle in order for the web to fulfill its true potential as a tool that serves all of humanity:  1) We’ve lost control of our personal data; 2) It’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web; 3) Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding.

**A formal spec for GitHub Flavored Markdown**  
https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/  
https://github.github.com/gfm/  
We’re hoping to improve on this situation by releasing a formal specification of the syntax for GitHub Flavored Markdown, and its corresponding reference implementation. This formal specification is based on CommonMark, an ambitious project to formally specify the Markdown syntax used by many websites on the internet in a way that reflects its real world usage.  

**Getting Started with CSS Grid**  
https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid/  
CSS Grid is the first real layout system for the web. It's designed for organizing content both into columns and rows and it finally gives developers almost God-like control of the screens before us. That means that we can finally ditch decades of hacks and workarounds for setting elements on a web page – ultimately it means that complex layouts and beautifully typeset pages are now not only possible but easy and maintainable. 另附：[How to Order and Align Items in Grid Layout](https://www.sitepoint.com/order-align-items-grid-layout/)。还不知道 CSS Grid 的请移步 Webkit 对它的介绍：[CSS Grid Layout: A New Layout Module for the Web](https://webkit.org/blog/7434/css-grid-layout-a-new-layout-module-for-the-web/)

**Scrolling on the web: A primer**  
https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/  
Scrolling is one of the oldest interactions on the web. Long before we had pull-to-refresh or infinite-loading lists, the humble scrollbar solved the web’s original scaling problem: how can we interact with content that’s stretched beyond the available viewport?

**Common Async/Await Design Patterns in Node.js**  
http://thecodebarbarian.com/common-async-await-design-patterns-in-node.js.html  
Async/await in Node.js opens up a host of powerful design patterns. Tasks that used to take complex libraries or intricate promise chaining can now be done with rudimentary if statements and for loops. I already wrote about these kind of design patterns with co, but async/await makes these patterns accessible in vanilla Node.js, no outside libraries required.

**The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity**

**Writing a JavaScript Framework - Client-Side Routing**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/writing-a-javascript-framework-client-side-routing/  
This is the last chapter of the Writing a JavaScript framework series. In this chapter, I am going to discuss how client-side routing in JavaScript differs from server-side routing and why should it be treated differently. The series is about an open-source client-side framework, called NX. During the series, I explain the main difficulties I had to overcome while writing the framework.å

**JOSE (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption) is a Bad Standard That Everyone Should Avoid**  
https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid  
There are several problems with the JOSE family of standards. These are not flaws specific to any particular implementation, and in fact many libraries work around the deficits of the standards.

**Lean Inception**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/  
Agile projects emphasize the early and continuous delivery of valuable software, whose value comes from business objectives and the needs of customers. Lean StartUp product creation helps this by promoting the incremental release of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — a simple version of a product that is given to users in order to validate the key business assumptions.

**Teams and the Way They Work**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/teams-way-work  
As soon as the job gets large enough, we need more than one person. People are great, however each person is unique, with a different skillset, knowledge base, history, value system and wants and needs. It is only when there is clear direction, shared desire to succeed, and clear boundaries that they will thrive and flourish.

学习的使命之一就是不断反思，永远保持怀疑和批判的精神。即便你已经从碎片化学习中受益良多，如果你仍然单纯享受碎片化学习中一阵阵“爽”的感觉，或者全然相信某些人兜售的碎片化学习资料，那么，你距离真正的学习还有挺长的距离。你正在的这期 Weekly 其实也是碎片化知识，只能帮你解决“信息 & 知道”的问题，真正要掌握技术，光靠这些远远不够，必须系统化地看书、看论文、看源代码，在编码实践中持续寻找解决问题的最佳方式，只有这样才能成为专业码农。
