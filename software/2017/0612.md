**V8 Release 6.0**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/06/v8-release-60.html  
V8 version 6.0, which will be in beta until it is released in coordination with Chrome 60 Stable in several weeks. V8 6.0 is filled will all sorts of developer-facing goodies. We’d like to give you a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release.

**JSC loves ES6**  
https://webkit.org/blog/7536/jsc-loves-es6/  
WebKit’s JavaScript implementation, called JSC (JavaScriptCore), implements all of ES6. ES6 features were implemented to be fast from the start, though we only had microbenchmarks to measure the performance of those features at the time. This post describes the development of our first ES6 benchmark, which we call ARES-6. We used ARES–6 to drive significant optimization efforts in JSC, and this post describes three of them: high throughput generators, a new Map/Set implementation, and phantom spread. The post concludes with an analysis of performance data to show how JSC’s performance compares to other ES6 implementations. 另附 Webkit 的其它更新：[WebKit has a full WebAssembly implementation](https://webkit.org/blog/7691/webassembly/), [Announcing WebRTC and Media Capture](https://webkit.org/blog/7726/announcing-webrtc-and-media-capture/)、[Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/)，这些特性将随 [Safari 11](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Safari_11_0/Safari_11_0.html) 发布.

**Node.js + MySQL Example: Handling 100's of GigaBytes of Data**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-mysql-example-handling-hundred-gigabytes-of-data/  
Through this Node.js & MySQL example project, we will take a look at how you can efficiently handle billions of rows that take up hundreds of gigabytes of storage space. My secondary goal with this article is to help you decide if Node.js + MySQL is a good fit for your needs, and to provide help with implementing such a solution.

**A Guide to Proper Error Handling in JavaScript**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/proper-error-handling-javascript/  
Ah, the perils of error handling in JavaScript. If you believe [Murphy’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. In this article, I would like to explore error handling in JavaScript. I will cover pitfalls, good practices, and finish with asynchronous code and Ajax.

**Upgrading from Node 6 to Node 8: a real-world performance comparison**  
https://hackernoon.com/upgrading-from-node-6-to-node-8-a-real-world-performance-comparison-3dfe1fbc92a3  
These performance comparisons are for a medium-to-large React site with a single page. On the server, it takes a JSON object with a few thousand properties and returns HTML with 2113 DOM nodes.

**Cloud Browser Architecture**  
https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-cloud-browser-arch-20170608/  
The Web and TV Interest Group has published a Group Note of Cloud Browser Architecture. A Cloud Browser is a browser running and executing on a server. This document describes the concepts and architecture for the Cloud Browser. The main purpose of this document is to provide the building blocks for a Cloud Browser solution.

**The Evolution of Code Deploys at Reddit**  
https://redditblog.com/2017/06/02/the-evolution-of-code-deploys-at-reddit/  
We’re constantly deploying code at Reddit. Every engineer writes code, gets it reviewed, checks it in, and rolls it out to production regularly. This happens as often as 200 times each week and a deploy usually takes fewer than 10 minutes end-to-end. The system that powers all of this has evolved over the years. Let’s take a look at how it’s changed (and how it hasn’t) over all that time.

**Google - Spinnaker 1.0: a continuous delivery platform for cloud**
http://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/06/spinnaker-10-continuous-delivery.html  
We’re happy to announce the release of [Spinnaker 1.0](https://www.spinnaker.io/), an open-source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform used in production at companies like Netflix, Waze, Target, and Cloudera, plus a new open-source command line interface (CLI) tool called halyard that makes it easy to deploy Spinnaker itself.

**[译]ES6 modules 即将到来，现在该考虑新的打包方案了嘛**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27276672  
ES6 modules(以下称ESM)已经定义到了ECMAScript规范里面有段时间了。社区的人们也写了很多文章布道怎么配合Babel来使用以及说明了import和node里的require的区别。但是在浏览器端完整的实现还需要一点时间。 很欣喜的看到Safari第一个在其工程预览版搭载ESM），现在Edge 和 Firefox Nightly也搭载了这个功能。在经历过使用像RequireJs Browserify（还记得AMD和common js之争吗）似乎modules终将到达浏览器领地，那么就让我们来看看未来将会带给我们什么吧。

**[译]自包含系统：打开微服务的正确方式**  
http://www.infoq.com/cn/articles/scs-microservices-done-right  
比微服务更进一步，UI 也独立，很多年前的 bigpipe 就是能做到类似的效果了

**WebView性能、体验分析与优化**  
http://tech.meituan.com/WebViewPerf.html  
在App开发中，内嵌WebView始终占有着一席之地。它能以较低的成本实现Android、iOS和Web的复用，也可以冠冕堂皇的突破苹果对热更新的封锁。然而便利性的同时，WebView的性能体验却备受质疑，导致很多客户端中需要动态更新等页面时不得不采用其他方案。那么如何克服WebView固有的问题呢？我们将从性能、内存消耗、体验、安全几个维度，来系统的分析客户端默认WebView的问题，以及对应的优化方案。

**Reducing our Redux code with React Apollo**  
https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/reducing-our-redux-code-with-react-apollo-5091b9de9c2a  
In this article, you’ll learn how we offloaded data fetching management to Apollo, which allowed us to delete nearly 5,000 lines of code. Not only is our application a lot slimmer since switching to Apollo, it’s also more declarative since our components only request the data that they need.

**Learn more about npm’s lockfiles**  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/161627993435/learn-more-about-npms-lockfiles  
npm5 introduces a lockfile, package-lock.json that keeps a record of every dependency your project uses and what version you have currently installed. Before npm5, this was behavior you could only get from npm shrinkwrap.

**Classes, Complexity, and Functional Programming**  
https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/classes-complexity-and-functional-programming-a8dd86903747  
When it comes to applications intended to last, I think we all want to have simple code that’s easier to maintain. Where we often really disagree is how to accomplish that. In this blog post I’m going to talk about how I see functions, objects, and classes fitting into that discussion.

**A Brief History of the UUID**  
https://segment.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-uuid/  
Today we’re releasing ksuid, a Golang library for unique ID generation. It borrows core ideas from the ubiquitous UUID standard, adding time-based ordering and more friendly representation formats. In doing the research that went into this library, we uncovered a compelling story that we wanted to share with a larger audience. 另附：[Be Careful with UUID or GUID as Primary Keys](https://tomharrisonjr.com/uuid-or-guid-as-primary-keys-be-careful-7b2aa3dcb439).

**The State Of Advanced Website Builders**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/advanced-website-builders/  
Advanced website builders — the tools provided by Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, The Grid and more — produce websites that look and feel like they were designed and coded by humans. They’re also software as a service, which is a different business model than traditional, custom-developed websites. So, should companies use them? At some point, will they replace custom development?

**How to do it like Google with this powerful checklist**

**Creating Yin and Yang Loaders On the Web**  
https://css-tricks.com/creating-yin-yang-loaders-web/  
I came across a couple such animations a while ago and this gave me the idea of creating my own versions with as little code as possible, no external libraries, using various methods, some of which take advantage of more recent features we can use these days, such as CSS variables. This article is going to guide you through the process of building these demos.

**The Future of MDN: A Focus on Web Docs**  
https://developer.mozilla.org/  
[MDN - Mozilla Developer Network]()’s mission today is to provide developers with the information they need to build things on the open Web. MDN is clearly a web documentation reference, and in no way is it a developer network. We want the name to clearly reflect the purpose and mission of MDN, and so we’re going to be updating it to: MDN Web Docs.

**Clone in Xcode**  
https://github.com/blog/2375-clone-in-xcode  
It's easy to explore code in your browser when you visit a GitHub repository, but you often want to pull that code directly into the appropriate editor and try it out. For example, if the repository contains an .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file, you might want to open that code in Xcode.

这几个心得很赞：职业不一样，是担起的担子，是对一群人包括自己的一种责任，有些事不喜欢不仅得做，还要做的漂亮；无论选择什么方向，一方面尽力做到最好；另一方面不要给自己设限，去接受更多挑战以提升自己；这样可能是比选择一个方向要更靠谱的方法；比选择更重要的是，成为一个某个产品或团队因为有你而变得更好的人。

**凯文凯利：真正的AI时代还未来临**  
http://newrss.guancha.cn/toutiao/toutiaopost/TMT/2017_06_09_412519.shtml
