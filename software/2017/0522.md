**Launching Ignition and TurboFan**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/05/launching-ignition-and-turbofan.html  
We are excited to announce the launch of a new JavaScript execution pipeline for V8 5.9 that will reach Chrome Stable in M59. With the new pipeline, we achieve big performance improvements and significant memory savings on real-world JavaScript applications. We’ll discuss the numbers in more detail at the end of this post, but first let’s take a look at the pipeline itself. 另附：[JavaScript engines - how do they even](https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/05/launching-ignition-and-turbofan.html)

**Polymer Release 2.0.0**  
https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2017-05-15-time-for-two  
Built on the fundamental goals of using native web platform features, improving interoperability, and providing a smooth migration path, the Polymer 2.0 library is a great support system for developing web components. One of the most exciting features of Polymer 2.0 is support for ES6 class-based syntax, so web components built with Polymer look essentially native. 

**Rearchitecting Airbnb’s Frontend**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rearchitecting-airbnbs-frontend-5e213efc24d2  
Airbnb 使用 React+Redux 重构了之前基于 Rails 开发的 Web 页面，挺不容易的，要改的地方及注意的问题不少

**How Four Native Developers Wrote An Electron App**  
https://githubengineering.com/how-four-native-developers-wrote-an-electron-app/  
Today we released the new GitHub Desktop Beta, rewritten on Electron. Electron is a well-known on-ramp for web developers to build desktop apps using familiar web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our situation was different. Everyone on the GitHub Desktop team is a native developer by trade—three from the .NET world and one from Cocoa. We knew how to make native apps, so how and why did we end up here?

**Why We Didn’t Use A Framework**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/why-no-framework/  
When we set out to build MeetSpace (a video conferencing app for distributed teams), we had a familiar decision to make: What’s our tech stack going to be? We gathered our requirements, reviewed our team’s skillset and ultimately decided to use vanilla JavaScript and to avoid a front-end framework.

**What's New in Create React App**  
https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/05/18/whats-new-in-create-react-app.html

**Yarn Create & Yarn 1.0**  
https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/12/introducing-yarn/  
With yarn create, you can start building apps with many of the existing projects. We are planning for the 1.0 release of Yarn which is scheduled for this summer and will come with stability improvements, new features and performance wins. To hear more about Yarn’s present and future, please watch Konstantin’s talk about [Building High-Quality JavaScript Tools](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2017/building-high-quality-javascript-tools/).

**Introducing Cape**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/05/introducing-cape/  
More than a billion files are saved to Dropbox every day, and we need to run many asynchronous jobs in response to these events to power various Dropbox features. Examples of these asynchronous jobs include indexing a file to enable search over its contents, generating previews of files to be displayed when the files are viewed on the Dropbox website, and delivering notifications of file changes to third-party apps using the Dropbox developer API. This is where Cape comes in — it’s a framework that enables real-time asynchronous processing of billions of events a day, powering many Dropbox features.

**Developing Microservices - Node, React, and Docker**  
http://mherman.org/blog/2017/05/11/developing-microservices-node-react-docker/  
In this post you will learn how to quickly spin up a reproducible development environment with Docker to manage a number of Node.js microservices.

**Guidelines for a new programming language**  
https://staltz.com/guidelines-for-a-new-programming-language.html  
This is a transcript of a talk I gave at CycleConf 2017 about a potential future for Cycle.js where we would explore building a functional and visual programming language for dataflow. It is part 2 of the talk “Past, Present and Future of Cycle.js”.

**REST 2.0 Is Here and Its Name Is GraphQL**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/rest-2-0-graphql/  
Throughout this article, we’re going to look at how you might tackle a few common use-cases with REST and GraphQL. This article comes complete with three projects. You will find the code for REST and GraphQL APIs that serve information about popular movies and actors as well as a simple frontend app built with HTML and jQuery.

**Web Developer Security Checklist**  
https://simplesecurity.sensedeep.com/web-developer-security-checklist-f2e4f43c9c56  
This checklist is simple, and by no means complete. I’ve been developing secure web applications for over 14 years and this list contains some of the more important issues that I’ve painfully learned over this period. I hope you will consider them seriously when creating a web application.

**Composing Software: An Introduction**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-an-introduction-27b72500d6ea  
This is the introduction to the “Composing Software” series on learning functional programming and compositional software techniques in JavaScript ES6+ from the ground up. Stay tuned. There’s a lot more of this to come!

**JSON Feed**  
https://jsonfeed.org/2017/05/17/announcing_json_feed  
The JSON Feed format is a pragmatic syndication format, like RSS and Atom, but with one big difference: it’s JSON instead of XML. For most developers, JSON is far easier to read and write than XML. Developers may groan at picking up an XML parser, but decoding JSON is often just a single line of code.

**JSONata - JSON query and transformation language**  
http://jsonata.org/  
JSONata is a lightweight query and transformation language for JSON data. Inspired by the ‘location path’ semantics of XPath 3.1, it allows sophisticated queries to be expressed in a compact and intuitive notation. A rich complement of built in operators and functions is provided for manipulating and combining extracted data, and the results of queries can be formatted into any JSON output structure using familiar JSON object and array syntax. 这是作者的介绍：[JSONata: A Declarative Syntax for Querying Your JSON Data](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/london-node-user-group/jsonata-a-declarative-syntax-for-querying-your-json-data)

**微信团队的实验室文化**

这几年来，微信每一次更新总能引起外界的集体狂欢。这次更新，大家关注的重点是“搜一搜”和“看一看”，说微信要干掉百度和头条。但有一件事，不知你想过没有：1）搜一搜、看一看的功能，早就是微信搜索框里的已有功能，这次并没有增加什么新能力；2）这两个功能被放在实验室里面，需要用户自己打开才能看到。既然是重仓搜索，为什么不是大张旗鼓直接推出这两个功能，要扭扭捏捏地干什么？所以重点不在搜和看，而在实验室。
