**The whole web at maximum FPS: How WebRender gets rid of jank**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/  
With WebRender, we want apps to run at a silky smooth 60 frames per second (FPS) or better no matter how big the display is or how much of the page is changing from frame to frame. And it works. Pages that chug along at 15 FPS in Chrome or today’s Firefox run at 60 FPS with WebRender. So how does WebRender do that? It fundamentally changes the way the rendering engine works to make it more like a 3D game engine.

**Building Browser Extensions At Scale**  
https://tech.grammarly.com/blog/building-browser-extensions-at-scale  
Over ten million people use the Grammarly Chrome extension. Our Firefox, Safari and Edge extensions are incredibly popular, too. These extensions may look easy on the outside because they are low profile and easy to use. But it is actually a complex product supported by a full team of engineers. We have been developing and perfecting it for 6 years. Along the way we have learned a thing or two that we’d like to share. This article is intended to be an overview of our learnings and best practices on a broad range of topics.

**Interesting JavaScript Libraries born in China**  
https://dashbouquet.com/blog/frontend-development/interesting-javascript-libraries-born-in-china  
We are taking a look at JavaScript Libraries born in China. Only three libraries in this article, but this is not to say that the Chinese are newbies in the JavaScript community. There are other interesting libraries born in China such as Amaze UI. However, for the purpose of this article; we are taking a look at: Ant.Design library, Dva library, Echarts library.

**Node.js State of the Union 2017**  
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-state-of-the-union-blog-2017-ed86640ec451  
Overall, Node.js is in a good place, but we can and will be better. We need to evaluate our systems and structures to make sure we are ready for the next 8 million Node.js instances and to help encourage a better more effective community and collaboration. Our future relies on our ability to adapt and nurture that success and drive toward a stronger ecosystem that involves more developers, solution providers and others who can continue the work that has been done to date. 另附：[Node.js Foundation Readies Official Developer Certification](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/10/Node-certified-developer-exam).

**Why Isn't the Construction of CRUD Web UIs 90% Automated?**  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15429616  
It seems silly to write the same types of code over and over to build CRUD web user interfaces. There have of course been hundreds of UI builders. Why aren't they used? Styling should just use plain CSS. Behavior should be mostly auto generated config from a standardized format such as json schema or a db schema. Behavior customizability should come from tweaking the auto generated json config, and adding some HTML and JavaScript to higher order components. The build targets should use plugins, starting with angular and react. Components should use a shared plugin infrastructure. Designers should be able to prototype in an invision like tool with real CSS and HTML that can be checked into source control. Why isn't this the way things are done?

**Evolution of GitHub's data centers**  
https://githubengineering.com/evolution-of-our-data-centers/  
Over the past 18 months we’ve made a significant investment in GitHub’s physical infrastructure. The goal of this work is to improve the redundancy and global availability of our system. In doing so we’ve solidified the foundation upon which we will expand our compute and storage footprint in support of our growing user base 另附：[Transit and Peering: How your requests reach GitHub](https://githubengineering.com/transit-and-peering-how-your-requests-reach-github/).

**Streaming Data Pipelines with Brooklin**

**当技术为组织所累时怎么办？将你的组织架构旋转90度**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650998289&idx=1&sn=af27e4141f347d800eb7f00f6d67bcb4  
Netflix 和阿里巴巴等高效能组织的一线实践表明，DevOps 和微服务架构是技术组织突破困局和转型升级的最佳实践。DevOps 和微服务转型本质上是一种组织架构重组 (Re-Org)：将技术组织旋转 90 度，从半职能半矩阵式组织转型到面向市场的跨职能混搭协作式组织，组织围绕微服务产品构建团队和开展研发运营。组织内部团队达成闭环，组织和市场之间达成闭环，更快更灵活地响应市场需求。

**Setting up Webpack, Babel and React from scratch, revisited**  
https://stanko.github.io/webpack-babel-react-revisited/  
Last summer I wrote this post which quickly became my most popular one to day. With webpack 2 and 3 it got outdated, so I decided to write a new one.

**A SIMPLE APPROACH TO BUILDING A REAL-TIME COLLABORATIVE TEXT EDITOR**  
http://digitalfreepen.com/2017/10/06/simple-real-time-collaborative-text-editor.html  
This post is my attempt to write an easy to understand introduction to the main ideas behind building a real-time collaborative text editor, which can be tricky as you want all clients to synchronize and see a sensible result even in the face of concurrent edits. In some ways, this is already a solved problem by Operational Transform (OT) and open-source implementations like Firepad and ShareJS.

**iPhone X notch advice for web developers**  
https://mobiforge.com/news-comment/iphone-x-notch-advice-for-web-developers  
Notches become necessary on edge-to-edge screen devices, if the device is to have any front-facing sensors. This Essential notch is a lot smaller than the iPhone X notch, since it only needs to accommodate a camera, while the iPhone’s notch houses a more complex and ultimately wider sensor array (including a Kinect-like depth-measuring sensor). 另附：[UI Design for iPhone X: Top Elements and the Notch](http://blog.maxrudberg.com/post/166045445103/ui-design-for-iphone-x-top-elements-and-the-notch)

**OpenTracing: An Open Standard for Distributed Tracing**  
https://thenewstack.io/opentracing-open-standard-distributed-tracing/  
Although tracing offers visibility into an application as processes grow in number, instrumenting a system for tracing has thus far been labor-intensive and complex. The [OpenTracing standard](https://thenewstack.io/opentracing-open-standard-distributed-tracing/) changes that, enabling the instrumentation of applications for distributed tracing with minimal effort.

https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/ansible-open-sources-ansible-tower-awx  
Ever since Red Hat acquired Ansible, I and many others have anticipated whether or when Ansible Tower would be open sourced. Ansible Tower is one of the nicest automation tools I've used... but since I haven't been on a project with the budget to support the Tower licensing fees, I have only used it for testing small-scale projects.

新零售，就是“用互联网的效率回到线下”，就是让线下的“体验性”和“即得性”优势，插上“效率”的翅膀。我们对这个“效率”有极致要求，那就是让线下的小米之家，和线上的小米商城，实现同款同价。这就是“小米的新零售”。电商认为：零售=流量x转化率x客单价x复购率。线下开店，上门推销，电话销售，校门口摆摊，一切的零售形态，其实最终都可以用这个公式来表示。对应到“电商对零售的理解”，坪效 =（流量x转化率x客单价x复购率）/ 面积。极致的坪效，是小米新零售的关键。
