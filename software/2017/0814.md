**JavaScript for People Who Hate JavaScript**  
https://zachholman.com/posts/javacript-haters  
I think 2017 is finally the year of “JavaScript on the Desktop”, where “DESKTOP” is an acronym for Developers Enjoy javascript now even though they thought it Sucked compared To Other Programming languages before.

**Harness the Power of Machine Learning in Your Browser with Deeplearn.js**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/harness-power-of-machine-learning-in.html  
With PAIR — an initiative to study and redesign human interactions with ML — we want to open machine learning up to as many people as possible. In pursuit of that goal, we are excited to announce [deeplearn.js](https://pair-code.github.io/deeplearnjs/) 0.1.0, an open source WebGL-accelerated JavaScript library for machine learning that runs entirely in your browser, with no installations and no backend. 

**Firefox fights back**  
https://www.cnet.com/special-reports/mozilla-firefox-fights-back-against-google-chrome/  
Inside Mozilla, CEO Chris Beard and his team are preparing to outmaneuver Google’s Chrome browser. The battle begins in November, with their release of Firefox 57.

**ES Modules in Node Today**  
https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/08/10/es-modules-node-today/  
https://medium.com/web-on-the-edge/es-modules-in-node-today-32cff914e4b  
[@std/esm (standard/esm)](https://github.com/standard-things/esm), an opt-in, spec-compliant, ECMAScript (ES) module loader that enables a smooth transition between Node and ES module formats with near built-in performance! This fast, small, zero dependency package is all you need to enable ES modules in Node 4+ today!

**The Rise of Test Impact Analysis**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/rise-test-impact-analysis.html  
Test Impact Analysis (TIA) is a modern way of speeding up the test automation phase of a build. It works by analyzing the call-graph of the source code to work out which tests should be run after a change to production code. Microsoft has done some extensive work on this approach, but it's also possible for development teams to implement something useful quite cheaply.

**React Animations in Depth**  
https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-animations-in-depth-433e2b3f0e8e  
5 Options for React Web Animations, and which of these are cross-platform.

**All About React Router 4**  
https://css-tricks.com/react-router-4/  
My intentions for this article aren't to rehash the already well-written documentation for React Router 4. I will cover the most common API concepts, but the real focus is on patterns and strategies that I've found to be successful.

**Prototyping with React VR**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/prototyping-with-react-vr-4d5ab91b6f5a
React VR provided a unique opportunity to leverage our expertise to rapidly test and iterate many of the VR ideas we’ve been playing with. To do this, we brought together a small team of React and VR experts at Airbnb Samara’s VR Lab to see what we could accomplish in the 3 weeks leading up to the React VR launch at F8. Here’s an overview of the technology that powers React VR and the similarities between React, React Native, and React VR.

**React Universal Component 2.0 & babel-plugin-universal-import**  
https://medium.com/faceyspacey/announcing-react-universal-component-2-0-babel-plugin-universal-import-5702d59ec1f4  
To the SPA crowd being able to use a variable within a dynamic import isn’t anything new (aka “dynamic expression”). And even though we haven’t had a general component that allows us to pass the name of the module to import() as a prop, that isn’t what’s significant either. This is about being able to dynamically import/require as part of a true universal component.

**About that hash flooding vulnerability in Node.js…**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/08/about-that-hash-flooding-vulnerability.html  
Early July this year, Node.js released a security update for all currently maintained branches to address a hash flooding vulnerability. This intermediate fix comes at the cost of a significant startup performance regression. In the meantime, V8 has implemented a solution which avoids the performance penalty. In this post, we want to give some background and history on the vulnerability and the eventual solution.

**Your Node.js authentication tutorial is (probably) wrong**  
https://hackernoon.com/your-node-js-authentication-tutorial-is-wrong-f1a3bf831a46  
I went on a search of Node.js/Express.js authentication tutorials. All of them were incomplete or made a security mistake in some way that can potentially hurt new users. This post explores some common authentication pitfalls, how to avoid them, and what to do to help yourself when your tutorials don’t help you anymore.

**Passing data between Promise callbacks**  
http://2ality.com/2017/08/promise-callback-data-flow.html  
In Promise-based code, there are usually many callbacks, each one having a separate scope for variables. What if you want to share data between those callbacks? This blog post describes techniques for doing so.

**[译]JavaScript 疲劳终极指南：我们行业的真相**

这篇文章的目的是希望改变你对软件工程行业的普遍的看法，助你在你可能工作的领域上一臂之力。

**W3CPlus中国创始人大漠：前端路上的旅行**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28406390  
前端工程师是计算机科学职业领域中最复杂的一个工种。绝大多数传统的编程思想已经不适用了，为了在多种平台中使用，多种技术都借鉴了大量软科学的知识和理念。成为优秀前端工程师所要具备的专业技术，涉及到广阔而复杂的领域，这些领域又会因为你最终必须服务的各方的介入而变得更加复杂。专业技术可能会引领你进入成为前端工程师的大门，但只有运用该技术创造的应用程序以及你跟他人并肩协同的能力，才会真正让你变得优秀。

**石墨文档大前端技术选型分享**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwNjQwMzUwMQ==&mid=2247485365&idx=1&sn=2b432d2a6b7296444454badebc87c9ce

**Easy Clean architecture on Android**  
http://www.jianshu.com/p/3edcf85539a6  
件设计，自己也做过很多不同的尝试，我不断地吸取教训并做出改变，直到我遇到了[Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)，我确定这就是我想要的，我决定使用它。本文的目标是分享我使用clean Architecture构建项目时所收获的经验，希望能够为你的项目改进带来灵感。

**Angular vs. React: Which Is Better for Web Development?**  
https://codeburst.io/angular-vs-react-which-is-better-for-web-development-e0dd1fefab5b    
There are countless articles out there debating whether React or Angular is the better choice for web development. Do we need yet another one? The reason I wrote this article is because none of the articles published already — although they contain great insights — go in-depth enough for a practical front-end developer to decide which one may suit their needs.

**Why Github can't host the Linux Kernel Community**  
http://blog.ffwll.ch/2017/08/github-why-cant-host-the-kernel.html  
The Linux Kernel is not going to move to github. But moving the Linux way of scaling with a monotree, but mutliple repos, to github as a concept will be really beneficial for all the huge projects already there: It’ll give them a new, and in my opinion, more powerful way to handle their unique challenges.

**A Behavior Driven Developer's guide to Infrastructure as Code**  
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/d-bbd-guide-iac/index.html  
The key benefit of BDD is that whenever a test fails, it means that you have a defect or your documentation is up to date. For instance, updating the feature documentation with a new security vulnerability means that your documentation is up to date because the feature files are the single source of truth. If that test fails, then it is a defect in your server configuration that needs to be changed.

**Principles of Sharding for Relational Databases**  
https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/08/09/principles-of-sharding-for-relational-databases/  
In this blog post, we’ll first look at key properties that impact a sharding project’s success. Then we’ll dig into the underlying reason why opinions on sharding differ from one another. When it comes to sharding a mature database, the type of application you’re building impacts your success more than anything else. 另附：[Timescale, an open-source time-series SQL database for PostgreSQL](http://www.timescale.com/).

**Best Practices For Enterprise Messaging UX, From Slack**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/best-practices-enterprise-messaging-ux-slack/  
Our extended UX guide walks you through designing a good experience end to end, but here, we’ll focus on a few things: Identify basic assumptions about users. Who are they? What do they know about and expect from your app? How do they expect to receive information? Consider UI aspects that are specific to messaging platforms, including available components and expected behaviors. Write app text for conversation (i.e. doing more with fewer words).

现代化让社会从“固态”变为“液态”；文化从“启迪”大众变为“诱惑”大众；商业由“生产者”主导变为由“消费者”主导；“时间轴”成为商业核心要素，“快”成为成败关键条件。

目标和梦想，一个人先要有一个大的目标，才有机会靠近这个目标；原则本质就是追求自我成长，原则就是尺子，你多给自己树立几把尺子，做事情就有了规矩。这些规矩就会给你带来更好的决定；学习还有个很重要的心态，我总结叫空杯心态，Stay Foolish，当然，真把自己看得很低，这一点，很难；行动：五年后的你，不是在跟今天的你做对比，而是和你的那些同龄人作对比。只有那个时候，你仍然卓尔不群，你才会有更多的机会。
