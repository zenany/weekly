**Node.js Forked Again Over Complaints of Unresponsive Leadership**  
https://thenewstack.io/node-js-forked-complaints-repeated-harassment/  
The codebase for popular Node.js JavaScript runtime has been forked again  — the second time in less than three years — with a growing number of contributors charging that the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) leadership is ignoring repeated violations of the project’s code of conduct. The new project, called [Ayo](https://github.com/ayojs/ayo), has already been set up on GitHub, and will be managed under an open governance model.

**External Library Management**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/08/external-library-management--making-continuous-delivery-reliable  
At LinkedIn, we tackle this challenge by importing external library dependencies into our own repository through the External Library Request (ELR) process. During this process we import and host each requested dependency, all of its metadata and all of its transitive dependencies. ELR process provides us with the ability to audit each dependency and remove reliance on external repositories.

**Easing the pain of building in JavaScript**  
http://2ality.com/2017/08/less-building-in-web-dev.html  
In principle, JavaScript is a very dynamic and interactive programming language. However, that has changed significantly in recent years. Now, modern web development requires extensive build and compilation steps. That is unfortunate for two reasons. First, it makes development less pleasant. Second, it makes web development harder to learn. This blog post covers ideas and tools for easing some of the pain of building.

**Inside a super fast CSS engine: Quantum CSS**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/  
And the first major component from Servo—a new CSS engine called Quantum CSS (previously known as Stylo)—is now available for testing in our Nightly version. You can make sure that it’s turned on for you by going to about:config and setting layout.css.servo.enabled to true. This new engine brings together state-of-the-art innovations from four different browsers to create a new super CSS engine. 另附：[Edge - Making the web smoother with independent rendering(https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/08/17/making-web-smoother-independent-rendering/).  

**How JavaScript works: inside the V8 engine + 5 tips on how to write optimized code**  
https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-inside-the-v8-engine-5-tips-on-how-to-write-optimized-code-ac089e62b12e  
This post will be diving into the internal parts of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. We’ll also provide a few quick tips on how to write better JavaScript code —best practices our development team at SessionStack follows when building the product.

**设计 Timeline 时间轴来更精确地控制动画**  
https://www.h5jun.com/post/timeline-for-animations.html  
Firefox 偷偷实现了一个 AnimationTimeline，用来为动画提供时间轴。根据文档，它是一个抽象类，被 DocumentTimeline 继承。由于是非标准的特性，MDN的文档里面也没有解释的很清楚，只是说它用来让多个动画共享时间轴，但是具体该怎么用，并没有详细的说明。今天在这篇文章里，我并不想解释 Firefox 实现的这个 Timeline 该怎么用，而是借着这个 Timeline 的概念进行一些扩展，实现了一个全新的 Timeline 库。让我们看看如果为动画或者其他依赖于时间的行为设计一个 Timeline，我们能做什么。

**美团点评数据平台融**  
https://tech.meituan.com/dataplat_coalesce.html

**从软件工程角度看大前端技术栈**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyNjE4NjI2Nw==&mid=2652559282&idx=1&sn=9b695d8f9fb5313a623e38e75c894b39  
我们都知道，大学几乎是没有 Web 前端课的。以我所在的大学为例，唯一引导我们了解 JavaScript 的也只是「人机界面」和「Web 应用开发」选修课。再者，由于这些选修课的课时短、面向的主要群体是大部分大学生等原因，其最终所涉及的内容层次也很难赶上近年来 Web 前端领域的快速变化。自学，看起来是广大前端学习者的普遍成长道路。本文尝试结合软件工程专业背景并贯穿软件工程思想，开启一个常常“不为人所知”的大前端技术栈之旅。

**iOS弹幕库OCBarrage-如何hold住每秒5000条巨量弹幕**  
http://www.jianshu.com/p/6593778a85e4  
弹幕量稍微大一点, 或者弹幕稍微复杂一点, 就会出现卡顿，这与它的底层实现, 设计策略以及你的使用方法都有关系. 关键是动画单一，无法定制，满足不了动画的多样化需求！OCBarrage正是为解决这些问题而生的！OCBarrage底层使用Core Animation驱动, Core Graphics绘图, GPU渲染, 性能极高, 哪怕是同时渲染5000条弹幕也不会感觉到卡顿.

**React 的许可协议到底发生了什么问题**

**CORS跨域资源共享你该知道的事儿**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU0OTExNzYwNg==&mid=2247483814&idx=1&sn=6fa914f7777fcc5a3a7961a37b84429b  
科普这个古老的概念。

**So you need a CSS utility library**  
https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/  
Let's define a CSS utility library as a stylesheet with many classes available to do small little one-off things. Like classes to adjust margin or padding. Classes to set colors. Classes to set specific layout properties. Classes for sizing. Utility libraries may approach these things in different ways, but seem to share that idea. Which, in essence, brings styling to the HTML level rather than the CSS level. The stylesheet becomes a dev dependency that you don't really touch.

**Web Frameworks: Using and Developing**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/08/23/web-frameworks-using-and-developing/  
In this post, we are going to explore how you might approach the workflow for a given framework, what sort of surrounding tooling is provided or recommended by the framework, how applications get built and deployed, and what sort of support there is for figuring things out when something inevitably goes wrong.

**How To Create A Sketch Plugin With Front-End Technologies**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/create-sketch-plugin-front-end-technologies/  
The open nature of the Sketch plugin system means that anyone can identify a need, write a plugin and share it with the community. A major barrier is stopping those eager to take part: Designers and front-end developers must learn how to write a plugin. Unfortunately, Objective-C is difficult to learn! What if users could write plugins using technologies they are already familiar with? This tutorial covers the usage of WebView technology to create a plugin using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**HTTP/2 Server Push with Node.js**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-http-2-push/  
Node.js 8.4.0 just arrived with the experimental support of HTTP/2, which you can enable by using the --expose-http2 flag. In this blog post, we will introduce the most important aspects of HTTP/2 Server Push and create a small Node.js app that gains benefit from using it.

**All the fundamental React.js concepts, jammed into this single Medium article**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-the-fundamental-react-js-concepts-jammed-into-this-single-medium-article-c83f9b53eac2  
This article is not going to cover what React is or why you should learn it. Instead, this is a practical introduction to the fundamentals of React.js for those who are already familiar with JavaScript and know the basics of the DOM API.

**Why I'm not a React Native Developer**  
https://arielelkin.github.io/articles/why-im-not-a-react-native-developer.html  
Having spent several months using React Native, I have found that it is neither a platform I would develop in, nor a platform I would recommend the use of. This article proposes to provide a more thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of switching from Swift development to React Native, and will argue against the switch. 另：[If you’re a startup, you should not use React (reflecting on the BSD + patents license)](https://medium.com/@raulk/if-youre-a-startup-you-should-not-use-react-reflecting-on-the-bsd-patents-license-b049d4a67dd2)

**Exploring and Visualizing an Open Global Dataset**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/exploring-and-visualizing-open-global.html  
Over the last six months, we’ve seen such a dataset emerge from users of Quick, Draw!, Google’s latest approach to helping wide, international audiences understand how neural networks work. And now we are releasing an open dataset based on these drawings so that people around the world can contribute to, analyze, and inform product design with this data. The dataset currently includes 50 million drawings Quick Draw! players have generated.

**Steering oceans of content to the world**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/565767133547005/steering-oceans-of-content-to-the-world/  
Facebook has built out a global network of points of presence (PoPs), each connected to tens or hundreds of networks. In order to support Facebook's growing external demand and internal services, we embarked several years ago on building in-house hardware and software systems to scale our global network.

**Open sourcing DoctorKafka: Kafka cluster healing and workload balancing**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/open-sourcing-doctorkafka-kafka-cluster-healing-and-workload-balancing-e51ad25b6b17  
To scale up the Kafka service operation, we built DoctorKafka, a service for Kafka cluster auto-healing and workload balancing. DoctorKafka can detect broker failures and automatically reassign the workload from failed brokers to healthy ones. It can also perform workload balancing based on the settings. Today we’re releasing DoctorKafka as an open source project on GitHub. In this post we’ll cover its architecture and how it can be useful to you.

**Perspective on Architectural Fitness of Microservices**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/Microservices-Architectural-Fitness  
In this article we examine the potential architectural fitness of microservices in the context of Master Data Management (MDM), and the challenges a microservices-based architecture may face when solving problem domains that require compute-intensive tasks, such as the calculation of expected losses on a portfolio of unsecured consumer credit.

**Ideal OS: Rebooting the Desktop Operating System Experience**  
https://joshondesign.com/2017/08/18/idealos_essay  
By the end of this essay I hope to convince you of the following facts. First, that modern desktop operating systems are anything but. They are bloated, slow, and layered with legacy cruft that still functions only thanks to Moore's Law. Second, that innovation in desktop operating systems stopped about 15 years ago and the major players are unlikely to heavily invest in them again. And finally, I hope to convince you that we can and should start over from scratch, learning the lessons of the past.
