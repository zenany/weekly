**Fast Properties in V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/08/fast-properties.html  
In this blog post we would like to explain how V8 handles JavaScript properties internally. From a JavaScript point of view there are only a few distinctions necessary for properties. JavaScript objects mostly behave like dictionaries, with string keys and arbitrary objects as values. The specification does however treat integer-indexed properties and other properties differently during iteration. Other than that, the different properties behave mostly the same, independent of whether they are integer indexed or not. This post explains the difference in handling integer-indexed and named properties. 

**FCR: Open source command runner for network devices**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/117615485632126/fcr-open-source-command-runner-for-network-devices-/  
FCR https://github.com/facebookincubator/FCR is a service that defines a Thrift interface for running commands on network devices. The service is independently scalable and allows people to focus on the business logic. FCR is part of our state-of-the-art Robotron system. We built Robotron's active monitoring features on top of FCR.

**Concurrent JavaScript: It can work!**  
https://webkit.org/blog/7846/concurrent-javascript-it-can-work/  
This post considers a wild thought experiment: what would it take to extend concurrency to the entire JavaScript heap? In this world, any object can be shared with other threads. This would be no small change. Existing JavaScript VM optimizations exploit the fact that there is only one thread of execution, so concurrency is sure to introduce some performance problems. This post is concerned with whether this is even technically feasible, and if it is, what the cost might be.

**How to Run a Front-End Infrastructure Team**  
http://tech.adroll.com/blog/frontend/2017/08/29/how-to-run-a-front-end-infrastructure-team.html

**Yes, That Web Project Should Be a PWA**  
https://alistapart.com/article/yes-that-web-project-should-be-a-pwa  
Progressive Web Apps may seem overly technical or beyond the needs of your project, but they’re really not. They’re just a shorthand for quality web experiences—experiences that can absolutely make a difference in our users’ lives. If you hadn’t considered building a PWA before, I hope this article has changed your mind. And if you’re already neck-deep in Service Workers, perhaps it’s given you some ideas for new ways to approach the projects you’re working on.

**How can I use CSS-in-JS securely?**  
https://reactarmory.com/answers/how-can-i-use-css-in-js-securely  
CSS-in-JS allows me to interpolate JavaScript variables into my CSS. This gives me a lot of power, but is it safe? What kind of exploits could a malicious user pull off using just CSS injection? And how can I defend against these?

**The art of over-engineering your side projects**  
https://elsyms.com/the-art-of-over-engineering-your-side-projects/  
Many software engineers who develop software as a hobby often have side projects. The sad thing is, those software engineers often have the tendency to over-engineer their side projects, put all of their effort into mundane and, let’s be honest, pointless tasks and burn out before they’ve even finished their MVP.

**IPv6 Performance – Revisited**  
https://blog.apnic.net/2016/08/22/ipv6-performance-revisited/  
At a finer level of detail, there are discernible differences between geographic regions. IPv6 appears to be faster on average in Europe, Africa and Oceania, while IPv4 is faster in Asia, and the Americas. At a further level of detail these differences between IPv4 and IPv6 extend to individual access networks where some networks appear to handle IPv6 packets in an entirely different manner to IPv4 packets.

**Transformer: A Novel Neural Network Architecture for Language Understanding**

**Low-Level Graphics on Linux**  
http://betteros.org/tut/graphics1.php  
This tutorial attempts to explain a few of the possible methods that exist on Linux to access the graphics hardware from a low level. I am not talking about using Xlib instead of GTK+ or QT5, nor am I talking about using DirectFB, I want to go even lower than that; I'm talking about drawing graphics to the screen without needing any external dependencies; I'm talking about communicating directly with the Linux kernel.

**Skeuomorphism, Flat Design, and the Rise of Type Design**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/type-design  
We started with skeuomorphic design then went to flat design, and now I think we should challenge ourselves to design interfaces like the ones we’ve admired in sci-fi with just type and little to nothing else. This new style can be called type design. We need a better solution for making designs that are faster to iterate but still look beautiful. Our flat designs are not so flat anymore—they take forever to work on, maintain, and change. I’m not saying we should ditch intricate designs entirely; I’m just saying we need a second option.

## 新鲜货

**r2**  
https://github.com/mikeal/r2  
Early in Node.js I wrote an HTTP client library called request. It evolved along with Node.js and eventually became very widely depended upon. A lot has changed since 2010 and I've decided to re-think what a simple HTTP client library should look like. This new library, r2, is a completely new approach from request. Rather than being built on top of the Node.js Core HTTP library and shimmed for the Browser, r2 is built on top of the browser's Fetch API and shimmed for Node.js. APIs are meant to be used with async await, which means they are based on promises.

企业就是根据某一信念，共同完成一件事情的一群人所组成的组织，也叫团队。企业文化在组织行为学里，指的是一群人所共同信仰的价值观，并且这些价值观总会在某些时刻发挥作用。它的价值并不体现在日常工作中，而是体现在关键事情发生时企业所采取的应对措施上。企业文化最大的特点就是能够形成一种“场”，这种“场”逼迫所有进入其内部的人进行改变，并逐渐变得相似统一起来。腾讯能够在众多具有相同能力的其他互联网公司中脱颖而出，就是因为它的企业文化永远保持开放性，对于外界创新保持敏感并不羞于向他人学习。
