**How to get the most out of the JavaScript console**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-the-javascript-console-b57ca9db3e6d  
One of the most basic debugging tools in JavaScript is console.log(). The console comes with several other useful methods that can add to a developer’s debugging toolkit. You can use the console to perform some of the following tasks: Output a timer to help with simple benchmarking; Output a table to display an array or object in an easy-to-read format; Apply color and other styling options to the output with CSS.

https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/a-crash-course-in-memory-management/  
This is the 1st article in a 3-part series: A crash course in memory management, [A cartoon intro to ArrayBuffers and SharedArrayBuffers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/a-cartoon-intro-to-arraybuffers-and-sharedarraybuffers/), [Avoiding race conditions in SharedArrayBuffers with Atomics](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/avoiding-race-conditions-in-sharedarraybuffers-with-atomics/). To understand why ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer were added to JavaScript, you need to understand a bit about memory management.

**企业级前端组件库方案**  
http://www.cnblogs.com/sskyy/p/7002404.html  
件库是前端大规模开发中提升效率的重要一环，同时也是可视化页面搭建、自动化测试等上层建筑的基石。因此设计时要考虑的问题涵盖面非常广。要设计好非常难，但是设计好之后从上层建筑带来的回报会超过你的想象。这篇文章中我们先一起来关注和探讨组件库要解决的问题，最后会推导出一套足够灵活——适用于大团队或社区使用，又足够强大——能支撑起上层建筑的组件库方案。也请读者注意，结论其实很简单，文中思考过程才是重点。知道结论并能让你一跃成为架构师，但知道了如何从系统角度设计局部却让你有机会可以。共勉。

**Android增量代码测试覆盖率工具**  
http://tech.meituan.com/android-jacoco-practace.html  
正常情况下，可以通过写单测来保证新增代码的覆盖率，但在实际开发中，由于单测部署成本高、项目排期比较紧张、需求变化频繁、团队成员能力不足等多种原因，单测在互联网行业普及程度并不理想。所以我们实现了这样一个工具，不需要写单测的情况下，在代码提交之前自动检测新增代码的手工测试覆盖率，避免新开发的功能没有经过自测就直接进入代码审查环节。

**SQLite small blob storage: 35% Faster Than the Filesystem**  
https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html  
SQLite reads small blobs (for example, thumbnail images) 35% faster¹ than the same blobs can be read from or written to individual files on disk using fread() or fwrite(). Furthermore, a single SQLite database holding 10-kilobyte blobs uses about 20% less disk space than storing the blobs in individual files.

**Developers Who Use Spaces Make More Money Than Those Who Use Tabs**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/  
This is certainly a surprising result, one that I didn’t expect to find when I started exploring the data. And it is impressively robust even when controlling for many confounding factors. As an exercise I tried controlling for many other confounding factors within the survey data beyond those mentioned here, but it was difficult to make the effect shrink and basically impossible to make it disappear. 相关文： [Tabs, spaces and your salary - how is it really](http://evelinag.com/blog/2017/06-20-stackoverflow-tabs-spaces-and-salary/index.html#.WU31cmQw2gw).

**For an Inclusive Culture, Try Working Less**  
https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea  
When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. When we do that, we allow diversity to flourish. If your culture expects people to work long hours or hang out off-hours, the strain on the people who are different, in whatever way, is increased, and your ability to retain a diverse work force is reduced. If you want to build an inclusive culture, build a minimum culture. Build it around professionalism, boundaries, and work-life balance. Make sure your senior staff walks the walk, and spreads the word.

**Lessons I've Learned from Three Million Downloads**  
http://jordansmith.io/lessons-ive-learned-from-three-million-downloads/  
Before writing an app that ‘made it’, I wrote plenty that didn’t make it. Design everything around the first time user. Listen to your critics, but don’t do what they say. A great product is better than a viral gimmick.

**你没死在“战略和格局”上，而会死在“最后1米”**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI2NTY4MDg1NA==&mid=2247487890&idx=1&sn=e622bd156493b3c92183c71b12b3b0fd  
人们总是热衷于关注和研讨一些高级话题，比如战略和格局之类，那些创业者以及大公司的管理者更是如此。这本无可厚非，战略思维和思考格局的确很重要。但是，仅凭这些高大上的东西并不能成功。我们看到，很多管理者脱离业务实际，整天到处参加聚会、演讲，张口闭口“倒逼、赋能、加持、all-in、布局、入口、大数据、云计算、人工智能”。他们的产品，均号称“智慧智能、贴心服务、一站式、全方位、业内领先、国际一流”。但当你实际使用一次他们的业务时，你会因为其糟糕的体验而感到无比震惊和愤怒。当然，世间也有不少低调务实的企业，他们不擅长“吹牛逼、画大饼”，只会用好的产品和服务来获得认可和尊重。战略和格局都类似，但为什么会产生天壤之别？这就涉及到产品“最后1米”的体验和服务是否良好的问题。所谓“最后1米”，类似于物流配送常说的“最后一公里”，指的是与用户紧密接触的产品、体验、包装、门店、客服等所有最后的关键环节。

这又是一篇劝大家“不要盲目崇拜”的文章。不过这次我列出了一长串有用的清单，或许能够帮助你们做出更好的决定。如果你还在使用 Google 搜索新技术来重建你的软件架构，那么我建议你不要再这么做了。相反，你可以考虑应用 UNPHAT 原则：在彻底了解（Understand）你的问题之前，不要急着去寻找解决方案。你的目标应该是在问题领域内“解决”问题，而不是在方案领域内解决问题；列出（eNumerate）多种方案，不要只把眼睛盯在你最喜欢的方案上；选择一个候选方案，并阅读相关论文（Paper）；了解候选方案的产生背景（Historical context）；比较优点（Advantages）和缺点，扬长避短；思考（Think），冷静地思考候选方案是否适合用于解决你的问题。另附一个和这篇文章观点类似的文章：[Excel与微服务](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MDMwOTcwMg==&mid=2650004876&idx=1&sn=bc4df15cace45d179b901b50dcf3b8ea)。
