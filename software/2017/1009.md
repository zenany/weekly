**An Internship on Laziness: Lazy Unlinking of Deoptimized Functions**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/10/lazy-unlinking.html  
I’ll explain how V8 used to unlink deoptimized functions, how we changed this, and what performance improvements were obtained. 附：[Optimizing ES2015 proxies in V8](https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/10/optimizing-proxies.html

**Essential Image Optimization**  
https://images.guide/  
We should all be automating our image compression. In 2017, image optimization should be automated. It's easy to forget, best practices change, and content that doesn't go through a build pipeline can easily slip. To automate: Use imagemin or libvips for your build process. Many alternatives exist. 附：[Fundamentals of Responsive Images](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/fundamentals-of-responsive-images)  

**Talk to Google at Node.js Interactive**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/10/talk-to-google-at-nodejs-interactive.html  
We’re headed to Vancouver this week, with about 25 Googlers who are incredibly excited to attend Node.js Interactive. With a mix of folks working on Cloud, Chrome, and V8, we’re going to be giving demos and answering questions at the Google booth. A few of us are also going to be giving talks. Here’s a list of the talks Googlers will be giving at the conference, ranging from serverless Slack bots to JavaScript performance tuning.

**Web Frameworks: Soundness**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2017/10/03/web-frameworks-soundness/  
While we have been comparing web frameworks to music, soundness in this context isn’t how good the framework sounds on a turntable. It is the concept of our code being in a good condition and robust. While we should and can test for this, helping us in other ways should be one of the main benefits of using a framework.

**前端中的 Pipeline**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28561932  
Pipeline 一般具有如下特点：各个子过程高内聚，专注于解决特定问题，Simple & Sharp；所有子过程具有一致的接口，例如从标准输入读取数据，正常结果输出到标准输出，异常结果输出到标准错误；能够通过一定形式将子过程组合起来解决复杂问题，例如 pipe。事实上，Pipeline 作为化整为零、去繁就简的重要手段，在前端中也有诸多应用。

**Lessons from migrating a large codebase to React 16**  
https://blog.discordapp.com/lessons-from-migrating-a-large-codebase-to-react-16-e60e49102aa6  
While the React team has diligently deprecated methods and packages throughout the last version, warning us strongly in console statements to upgrade, the actual final migration is not trivial for larger codebases. We at Discord just launched our React 16 based app and wanted to share our experience and some tips we learned along the way.

**The 100% correct way to structure a React app (or why there’s no such thing)**  
https://hackernoon.com/the-100-correct-way-to-structure-a-react-app-or-why-theres-no-such-thing-3ede534ef1ed  
In this post, I’d like to tell you how I structure my React apps, and what drove my decisions. Along the way I’ll mention some options I don’t use because they don’t suit me, but that might serve you well.

**Publishing what you mean to publish**  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/165769683050/publishing-what-you-mean-to-publish  
You, as a developer publishing to npm, want to avoid leaking your data like this. I’ll share some tips for how to control what you’re publishing and keep your secrets out of the public registry.  另附：[Protect your npm account with two-factor authentication and read-only tokens](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/166039777883/protect-your-npm-account-with-two-factor)

**Size Limit:Make the Web lighter**  
https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/size-limit-make-the-web-lighter  
Keep your JavaScript dependencies and polyfills in check and find out what exactly makes your code bloat with Size Limit. To demonstrate, we will code a simple library together, and then shrink its browser bundle so that it takes 5 000 (yes, five thousand) times less space than initially.

**Text Editor: Data Structures**  
http://www.averylaird.com/programming/the%20text%20editor/2017/09/30/the-piece-table/ 
I researched several data types, and I tried to be language agnostic. I wanted my decision to not be influenced by any particular language, and first see if there was a “best way” out there, solely based on operations. Of course, a “best way” rarely exists. However, in the case of text manipulation and storage, there are some clear “worst ways” and “better ways.” 另附：[The Craft of Text Editing](http://www.finseth.com/craft/)

**How we created a design system for the U.S. government**  
https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/10/03/building-a-large-scale-design-system/  
I was part of a team of designers and developers who unified a complex system with numerous rules to serve users from all corners of the country. I’ll shed some light on how we built tools to leverage industry-standard best practices and produce a design system with reusable components. You’ll also see how our system is helping agency teams in the federal government create simple, efficient, consistent experiences quickly and at reduced cost.

**CSS Grid Challenge: Winners and Templates**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/css-grid-challenge-2017-winners/  
One of the main reasons behind the idea of the CSS Grid Challenge was to have some starting points for layouts, and show what can be achieved with CSS Grids today. So without a further ado, let’s look at the submissions which we think are the most impressive ones.

**Functional Minimalism for Web Design**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/functional-minimalism-for-web-design/  
Minimalist websites simplify interfaces by removing unnecessary elements and paring down content that does not support user tasks. What makes such websites inspiring is the combination of usability and great aesthetics: An easily navigable, beautiful website is a powerful vehicle of communication.

**statty**  
https://github.com/vesparny/statty  
statty is meant to manage app-wide state and can be thought of as a simplified version of Redux. It safely leverages context to expose application state to children, along with a function to update it when needed. The update function acts like Redux dispatch, but instead of an action, it takes an updater function as a parameter that returns the new state. This way it's easy to write testable updaters and to organize them as you prefer, without having to write boilerplate code.

**Y Combinator's Founding Principles**  
http://www.ycombinator.com/principles/  
From the point YC funds a startup we should put the founders’ interests first, before even our own. We must remember that we’re investors, not bosses. We can advise and persuade, but not command. What drove us in starting YC was that it seemed a cool hack: that if we helped founders in the earliest stages, there could be a lot more successful startups. That hypothesis turned out to be correct, and it has a long way to run. Focus on helping founders, and everything else will follow.
