**Simple React Development in 2017**  
https://hackernoon.com/simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f
Regardless of your background, you’ve likely had a similar experience: React itself seems pretty straightforward, but the tooling and ecosystem is overwhelming. However, this is a solved problem! Believe it or not, it is actually very simple and painless to start a new React project, thanks to amazing work by the community over the past year. The goal of this guide is to showcase how easy it can be to start modern React development. It shares a step-by-step process, from initial system setup through to deployment, without straying into tangent explanations that aren’t critical at this point in the learning process.

**Building For Mobile: RWD, PWA, AMP Or Instant Articles?**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/building-for-mobile-rwd-pwa-amp-instant-articles/
Today, as our findings indicate, responsive web design is the norm, with 7 out of 10 mobile-optimized websites being responsive, up from 5 last year, which begs the questions: What’s next? Where is it all heading? We solved the screen-size issue and had a great run for a few years — now what?

**如何向开源项目提交无法解答的问题**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25795393
作为一名互联网开发者，本人使用和参与过许多开源项目。开源社区里，提问和回答是最有趣的组成部分，有些你来我往，有些则石沉大海。人们提问的方式有许多迷人和实用的共通之处。我把它们提炼出来，希望能帮助到那些像我一样充满了好奇心、且愿意付诸行动去惹恼开源项目维护者的人们。

**Powering UberEATS with React Native and Uber Engineering**  
https://eng.uber.com/ubereats-react-native/
In this article, we focus on one challenge in particular: how Uber Engineering handled introducing a third party to what had previously been a two-sided marketplace.

**Memory-Efficient Image Passing in the Document Scanner**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/03/memory-efficient-image-passing-in-document-scanner/
Speed is not the only thing that matters in a mobile environment: what about memory? Bounding both peak memory usage and memory spikes is important, since the operating system may terminate the app outright when under memory pressure. In this blog post, we will discuss some tweaks we made to lower the memory usage of our iOS document scanner.

**ARIA Grid: Supporting nonvisual layout and keyboard traversal**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1232839800098854/aria-grid-supporting-nonvisual-layout-and-keyboard-traversal/
At Facebook, we are experimenting with a user interface pattern for traversing a page with a keyboard that we call a logical grid. A logical grid reduces numerous tab stops to a single tab stop within a part of the interface designated as a grid. From the single tab stop, a person can traverse items in the grid using arrow keys.

**A11Y Style Guide**

**React London 2017 Conference Report**  
<https://www.magnolia-cms.com/blogs/christopher-zimmermann/detail~&react-london-2017-conference-report~.html>
In this blog post I hope to get you up to speed on what was presented at the conference. I’ll do a short blow-by-blow rundown of a few of the presentations and then share one person's perspective of the themes that emerged during the day. 另附：[MobX vs Redux: Comparing the Opposing Paradigms - React Conf 2017 纪要](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25989654)  

**React Lifecycle Methods- how and when to use them**  
https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1
In an ideal world, we wouldn’t use lifecycle methods. All our rendering issues would be controlled via state and props. But it’s not an ideal world, and sometimes you need to exact a little more control over how and when your component is updating. Use these methods sparingly, and use them with care. I hope this article has been helpful in illuminating when and how to use lifecycle methods.

**6 Reasons Why JavaScript’s Async/Await Blows Promises Away**  
https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9
In case you missed it, Node now supports async/await out of the box since version 7.6. If you haven’t tried it yet, here are a bunch of reasons with examples why you should adopt it immediately and never look back.

**React Fiber是什么**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26027085
使用React的同学们都应该要知道React Fiber，因为这玩意快要正式发布了。据说Facebook在自己的网站已经将React Fiber投入实战，所以，React Fiber大势所趋，是时候了解一下React Fiber了。React Fiber是个什么东西呢？官方的一句话解释是“React Fiber是对核心算法的一次重新实现”。这么说似乎太虚无缥缈，所以还是要详细说一下。

**精读 js 模块化发展**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26118022
前端精读期刊与大家第一次正式碰面，我们每周会精读并分析若干篇精品好文，试图讨论出结论性观点。这期的主题是：[The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity](https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity)。

**IMVC（同构 MVC）的前端实践**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwNjQwMzUwMQ==&mid=2247485119&idx=1&sn=5cd3855a84cd0a7bfd5b7c69ac853258
React/Vue 和 Redux/Vuex 是分别在 MVC 中的 View 层和 Model 层做了进一步发展。如果 MVC 中的 Controller 层也推进一步，将得到一种升级版的 MVC，我们称之为 IMVC（同构 MVC）。IMVC 可以实现一份代码在服务端和浏览器端皆可运行，具备单页应用和多页应用的所有优势，并且可以这两种模式里通过配置项进行自由切换。配合 Node.js、Webpack、Babel 等基础设施，我们可以得到相比之前更加完善的一种前端架构。

**[译]一份关于Angular的倡议清单**

Angular虽然是一个优秀的功能全面的JavaScript框架，但是如果停滞不前将逐渐丧失活力。新的特性会为开发者提供更强大的功能和新的机会来构建更完美的App。Eamon O'Tuathail在本文中将会提出一些如何让Angular更新潮更令人振奋的发展建议。

**CURL IS C**  
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/03/27/curl-is-c/
Every once in a while someone suggests to me that curl and libcurl would do better if rewritten in a “safe language”. Rust is one such alternative language commonly suggested. This happens especially often when we publish new security vulnerabilities. At the end of the day the question that remains is: would we gain more than we would pay, and over which time frame? Who would gain and who would lose? CURL 的维护者对技术选型的考虑挺值得参考的。

**Scaling your API with rate limiters**  
https://stripe.com/blog/rate-limiters
Rate limiting is one of the most powerful ways to prepare your API for scale. The different rate limiting strategies described in this post are not all necessary on day one, you can gradually introduce them once you realize the need for rate limiting. 另附：[如何设计一个小而美的秒杀系统 ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5Nzc4OTA1Mw==&mid=2659599014&idx=1&sn=14ffbf9307b0f11fd218285c837204f2)

**Thirteen Years of Bad Game Code**  
http://etodd.io/2017/03/29/thirteen-years-of-bad-game-code/
There are many, many more embarrassing mistakes to discuss. I discovered another "creative" method to avoid globals. For some time I was obsessed with closures. I designed an "entity" "component" "system" that was anything but. I tried to multithread a voxel engine by sprinkling locks everywhere. Here's the takeaway: Make decisions upfront instead of lazily leaving them to the computer; Separate behavior and state; Write pure functions; Write the client code first; Write boring code.

**Modules vs. microservices**  
https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/modules-vs-microservices
Much has been said about moving from monoliths to microservices. Besides rolling off the tongue nicely, it also seems like a no-brainer to chop up a monolith into microservices. But is this approach really the best choice for your organization? It’s true that there are many drawbacks to maintaining a messy monolithic application. But there is a compelling alternative which is often overlooked: modular application development. In this article, we'll explore what this alternative entails and show how it relates to building microservices.

**Chromium policy on JavaScript dialogs**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/dialogs-policy
While they fit into the JavaScript of the time, their synchronous API is problematic for modern browsers. Because the JavaScript engine needs to pause until a user response is obtained, the JavaScript dialogs are app-modal. And because the dialogs are app-modal, they commonly (and unfortunately) are used to harm our users. Because of this, the Chromium team highly recommends that you not use JavaScript dialogs.

阮老师的核心观点：技术正变得越来越先进，也越来越难懂，大多数人已经不能够理解技术了，技术高速发展所蕴含的巨大能量，最终将把人类社会带到难以预测的脆弱状态。BTW：银河帝国基地系列也是从技术发展到一定程度后人们已不能理解很多大型复杂设备背后的技术导致的危机开始讲起的。银河帝国、海波利安这两部科幻小说在一定程度把 AI 的推演到极致了，感兴趣的同学可以看看，保证让你脑洞大开，这两本书中人类最后的命运都是由人工智能在推动。

愚人节 Reddit上线了一个叫做Place的节点，它是一块空白的巨大画布，每个用户每10分钟会得到一个机会，可以选一种颜色，在上面点一个点（后来间隔时间被修改成5分钟）。规则本身非常简单，但和Reddit的气质非常贴合，Reddit本来就是一个靠投票和用户贡献来产生内容的网站，用户参与度很高。这不仅是一个出色的愚人节项目，也是一个伟大的尝试，在这种完全自由，不受管控，只有简单规则的活动里面，人们之间会产生什么样的互动？

在我的二十年程序员生涯中，我与其他程序员一起工作，作为同事，或者由我指导他们达成目标，为Redis和其他项目贡献代码补丁。在工作过程中，我仔细观察他们。与此同时，有很多人说我是一个高能的程序员。不过我不认为自己是一个工作狂，我只是编码速度比较快而已。
