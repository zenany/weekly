**V8 release v6.4**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/12/v8-release-64.html  
V8 v6.4 improves the performance of the instanceof operator by 3.6×. As a direct result, uglify-js is now 15–20% faster according to V8’s Web Tooling Benchmark. V8’s built-in code objects and bytecode handlers are now deserialized lazily from the snapshot, which can significantly reduce memory consumed by each Isolate.

**I just asked 23,000 developers what they think of JavaScript. Here’s what I learned**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-asked-23-000-developers-what-they-think-of-javascript-heres-what-i-learned-9a06b61998fa  
I recently published our results for the 2017 edition of the annual State of JavaScript survey, collected from over 23,000 developers. The results revealed many things, from popularity trends to salary breakdowns. You’ll want to take a look for yourself if you haven’t done so already. But among all these data, here are the 10 things that stood out most to me. 另附来自 npm 的 [2017 JavaScript Ecosystem Survey](http://info.npmjs.com/2017-JavaScript-Ecosystem-Survey)  

**A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet**  
https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html  
We need to realize that the Web can be independent from the Internet. The core weaknesses of the Internet have to be recognized, and how exactly they were exploited by middlemen businesses. The problem we are solving is both social and technical, so the solution must be a harmony of these two. Finally, all the tools and opportunities we need to supersede them are already in our hands: smartphones, peer-to-peer protocols, and mesh networks.

**Why ‘mobile first’ may already be outdated**  
https://blog.intercom.com/why-mobile-first-may-already-be-outdated/  
If “mobile first” is no longer your dogma, then what is? At Intercom our dogma is the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. Focusing on what Jobs your users are trying to do. Servicing those Jobs where they happen. Servicing them with the right depth of product experience: maybe a glance on a watch is best, maybe a 40 inch screen dashboard view is best. Servicing them in a way that takes advantage of the situational context of use – no one is bringing their iMac to the beach, and no-one is writing the board deck on their phone. So think about the screen best suited for input, and the screen best suited for output.

**Developer Experience First —— TWA 的理念与实践**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32219319  
TWA 是以提升开发者研发体验为核心的渐进式解决方案，给 H5 App 开发者 提供从框架、研发流程到运行时的完整支持。此处的 Techless 并不意味着它是一个没有技术含量的解决方案，而是我们期望让产品研发可以更好的关注在产品实现上，不用过于关注“应用”、“构建”、“部署”、“流程”等细节。另附来自蚂蚁金服体验科技的另一篇文章：[可视化图形语法概述](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32178892)

**如果我们能从头开始，web编程会是什么样子？**  
https://www.zhihu.com/question/264445652/answer/282303246  
这是一个值得每个前端码农思考的问题。民工叔叔的回答很赞，另附叔的 [最近的一次讨论记录](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32273365)，关于状态管理和框架。

**美团金融扫码付静态资源加载优化实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/qrcodepayment-static-optimize.html  
ThunderJS 定制加强了与静态资源托管（公司自研的Build Service）结合的能力，能够让我们对静态资源的加载进行针对性的优化，而在 C 端项目中，静态资源的加载优化是我们尤为重视的。本文主要介绍基于 ThunderJS 和 Build Service 的产品优化方案。

**[译]ESR：程序语言设计的要诣和真谛**  
https://linux.cn/article-9162-1.html  
当你真正掌握了整体化的工程设计思维时，你就会发现高屋建瓴的工程设计已经远远超越了技术优化的层面。语言设计中需要侧重的目标重新归纳为两部分: （1）以时间的远近为轴，在远景设计和近景设计之间选取一个符合预期的最佳平衡点；（2）降低由一种或多种语言转化为这种新语言的转入成本，这样就可以更好地吸纳其它语言的用户群。另附，ESR的 [C, Python, Go, and the Generalized Greenspun Law](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7804)

**一万亿张图片的存储架构与4个9可用性的重构**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650999959&idx=1&sn=a78df9cff42b78c091d01549c52afe00  
QQ 相册作为重量级资深业务，稳定运营、有效容灾，一直是相册团队追求的目标。QQ 相册架构一直在演变进化，本文重点介绍相册最新的一次重构细节。重构进行了大规模的存储搬迁、功能模块合并，抽象了图片上传“两阶段”，并在此之上设计了轻量级的容灾方案。新架构精简了大量模块，优化了图片上传流程，减轻了运维工作，从实际运营效果看，系统稳定达到 4 个 9 的服务质量，并具备跨 IDC 容灾的能力。

**九年双11的云化架构演进和升级**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzOTU0NTQ0MA==&mid=2247486594&idx=1&sn=8dfa1855044dd516ac0e2aa897d638f4  
双11峰值的本质是用有限的成本最大化提升用户体验和集群吞吐能力，用合理的代价解决峰值。面对增长如何发挥规模效应，持续降低单笔交易成本，提升峰值吞吐能力，为用户提供丝般顺滑的浏览和购物体验，这是极大的挑战。

**Docker说了这么多 最全的一篇在这里**

**How GitLab switched to Headless Chrome for testing**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2017/12/19/moving-to-headless-chrome/  
We now have a truly accurate way to test GitLab within a real, modern browser. The switch has improved our ability to write tests and debug them while running them directly in Chrome. Plus the change forced us to confront and clean up a number of hacks we had been using in our tests. 另附：[GitLab 10.3 released with Static Application Security Testing and Browser Performance Testing](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/12/22/gitlab-10-3-released/)

**Robust Client-Side JavaScript – A Developer’s Guide**  
https://molily.de/robust-javascript/  
The JavaScript programming language is an essential tool of web developers today. Websites ship more and more JavaScript to the browser to be more interactive. The more complex client-side JavaScript gets, the more error-prone and fragile the user experience might get. Why do we need to talk about robust JavaScript and how do we achieve it?

**Why Web Developers Need to Care about Interactivity**  
https://philipwalton.com/articles/why-web-developers-need-to-care-about-interactivity/  
Anyone who’s browsed the web on their phone has, at one point or another, experienced this situation: You open a web page and click on something, but nothing happens; You click on it again—still nothing happens; You click on something else—nope, nothing. This is bad enough on its own, but it often doesn’t end there. I want to dig into the meaning of interactivity on the web. After all, I think it’s one of the most important things developers need to care about.

**Top UX design trends for 2018 – expert predictions**  
https://www.justinmind.com/blog/top-ux-design-trends-for-2018-10-experts/  
Looking at immersive technologies, I think mass adoption will come once we have mainstream Social Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) platforms – which is unlikely to happen as early as 2018 though. Social is the way forward, simply because experiences are better when they’re shared.

服务设计这个概念在最近几年变得非常火热，让很多人听了就觉得兴奋。总感觉作为一个设计师，如果连这个概念都不知道就已经out了。然而别人口中的服务设计，真的有传说的这么神吗？真的能在我们的日常工作中应用吗？我们不妨都冷静下来，先对服务设计进行更多了解探索，再来认识它的实际价值。而要弄清楚何谓服务设计，我们需要先从互联网设计的几个核心阶段的演变说起。
