## 深阅读

**Welcome 2.0 Release Candidate!**  
https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2017-03-08-2-0-rc  
The new library is more modular than before, starting at just 10kb for Polymer.Element, the base class to extend elements from. We’ve squeezed out even more performance increases on native browsers, like Safari Tech Preview and Chrome. Polymer 2.0 remains focused on bringing development closer to the platform than ever before, leveraging the power of the browser to build performant, large-scale applications.

**WebAssembly: Under the hood with Mozilla**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o52_5qAJhNg  
Take a closer look at how WebAssembly works, how this relates to JavaScript, and how it was all developed. It all started with an experimental project at Mozilla by research engineer Alon Zakai to develop emscripten, and grew into asm.js with the help of Luke Wagner and Jukka Jylänki, and finally into a cross-browser collaboration on WebAssembly.  另附：[Previewing the WebAssembly Explorer](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/03/previewing-the-webassembly-explorer/)

**Welcome to the Grid**  
http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2017/03/07/welcome-to-the-grid/  
Grid is public.  It’s live right now in the latest Firefox release, Firefox 52. It will similarly be live in the next public Chrome release, due in the next week or so. 另附：[Firefox 52: Introducing Web Assembly, CSS Grid and the Grid Inspecto](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/03/firefox-52-introducing-web-assembly-css-grid-and-the-grid-inspector/)、[Webkit - CSS Grid Layout: A New Layout Module for the Web](https://webkit.org/blog/7434/css-grid-layout-a-new-layout-module-for-the-web/)、[Playing with CSS Grids](https://14islands.com/blog/2017/03/07/playing-with-CSS-grids/)、[CSS Grid: First Steps](http://jeffbridgforth.com/css-grid-first-steps/)

**The System Design Primer**  
https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer  
Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer. System design is a broad topic. There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on system design principles. This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

**SelfEncapsulation**  
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfEncapsulation.html  
Self-encapsulation goes a step further, indicating that all internal access to a data field should also go through accessor methods as well. Only the accessor methods should touch the data value itself. If the data field isn't exposed to the outside, this will mean adding additional private accessors.

**Practical Design Discovery**  
https://alistapart.com/article/practical-design-discovery  
One of the hardest design problems I ever worked on was for a company that helps IT groups manage risk. Their product focused on open-source components—inexpensive and widely supported by an enormous community, but often vulnerable to security flaws.

**Analysing the use of outdated JavaScript libraries on the web**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/03/07/thou-shalt-not-depend-on-me-analysing-the-use-of-outdated-javascript-libraries-on-the-web/  
In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of client-side JavaScript library usage and the resulting security implications across the Web. Using data from over 133K websites, we show that 37% of them include at least one library with a known vulnerability; the time lag behind the newest release of a library is measured in the order of years.

**The Document Outline Dilemma**  
https://css-tricks.com/document-outline-dilemma/  
For the past few weeks there has been lots of talk about HTML headings in web standards circles. Perhaps you've seen some of the blog posts, tweets, and GitHub issue threads. Headings have been part of HTML since the very first websites at CERN, so it might be surprising to find them controversial 25 years later. I'm going to quickly summarize why they are still worth discussing, with plenty of links to other sources, before adding my own opinions to the mix.

**Create Offline Web Apps Using Service Workers & PouchDB**  
https://www.sitepoint.com/offline-web-apps-service-workers-pouchdb/  
In this post, we will look at how to add offline support to a basic contact list web app by implementing asset caching, client-side data storage and synchronization with a remote data store.

**You might not need a build tool**  
https://medium.com/@pakastin/you-might-not-need-a-build-tool-ac3c1a8cfaac#.292wkw23z  
Build tools come in all size and color. But do you really need them? Wouldn’t it be easier to just follow the original CLI documentation of Rollup, Stylus or whatever and call it a day? Not to mention they add up a lot of dependencies. I’m going to show you the “native” way with NPM scripts and chokidar.

**The 80/20 Guide to Async/Await in Node.js**  
http://thecodebarbarian.com/80-20-guide-to-async-await-in-node.js.html  
Arguably the biggest new feature in Node.js 7.6.0 is that the much awaited async function keyword is now available without a flag. Callback hell and promise hell are now in the past. But, like Uncle Ben always reminded us, with great power comes great responsibility, and async/await gives you a lot of new and exciting ways to shoot yourself in the foot. You still need to handle errors and be aware of the async nature of your code, otherwise you'll inevitably be complaining about "async/await hell" in 6 months.

**Reducing Slack’s memory footprint**  
https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb#.cucelx1xd  
降低后台页面的内存消耗

**Introducing Similarity Search at Flickr**  
http://code.flickr.net/2017/03/07/introducing-similarity-search-at-flickr/  
At Flickr, we understand that the value in our image corpus is only unlocked when our members can find photos and photographers that inspire them, so we strive to enable the discovery and appreciation of new photos.To further that effort, today we are introducing similarity search on Flickr.

**Netflix Downloads on Android**  
http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/03/downloads-on-android.html  
Netflix is now a global company, so we wanted to provide a viewing experience that was truly available everywhere even when the Internet is not working well. This led to these three prioritized download use cases: Better, uninterrupted videos on unreliable Internet; Reducing mobile data usage ;Watching Netflix without an Internet connection (e.g. on a train or plane).

**那些年，我们一起写过的“单例模式”**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wEK3UcHjaHz1x-iXoW4_VQ  
结合我们的 Android 项目，谈谈大家在其中使用到的一些设计模式。一则，就个人的学习经验看来，研究例子是最容易学会设计模式的方式；二则，其实设计模式的应用同所使用的编程语言和环境都是有关系的，譬如说，我们最先要讨论的单例模式，在 Java 中实现的时候就要特别注意不同 JDK 版本对该模式造成的影响。

**浏览器亚像素渲染与小数位的取舍**  
https://isux.tencent.com/subpixel-rendering-and-percentage-calculations.html  
对于小数位的处理，不同的浏览器有不同的处理方法，主要有三种：处理成整数、保留4位小数或保留15位小数。现代浏览器基本支持保留小数位的处理。由于显示器是由像素单元组成的，对于小于1像素的部分，是无法像像素级那样精确地处理的，而是采用亚像素渲染的方式进行处理

**卡通渲染-致从没看懂过着色器代码的你**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25595069  
其实不仅仅是前端，图形渲染对于整个软件工程来说，都是一个很特定的研究领域。这就意味着，大部分情况下，你可能并没有那么迫切的需求去学习它。这也是为什么，WebGL 标准推出了那么多年，在前端的各种分享会上，即使介绍，也永远都是 Hello World。这一系列主要针对使用着色器实现不同效果的渲染算法作介绍。对图形有兴趣的同学可以关注这个专栏。

**腾讯游戏的运维服务是什么样的**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4Nzg5Nzc5OA==&mid=2651664891&idx=1&sn=68641b2afc904868e1f05fd9f3a23680

**I wanted to see how far I could push myself creatively. So I redesigned Instagram**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-wanted-to-see-how-far-i-could-push-myself-creatively-so-i-redesigned-instagram-1ff99f28fa8b#.1isyluuzv  
The challenge: to take an application I love and use everyday, then see how far I could push myself creatively as a designer, by rebuilding it from the ground up.

**Sketch Vs. Figma: The Showdown**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/sketch-figma-showdown/  
The past year has seen quite a rise in UI design tools. While existing applications, such as Affinity Designer, Gravit and Sketch, have improved drastically, some new players have entered the field, such as Adobe XD (short for Adobe Experience Design) and Figma. In this article, I’d like to compare both apps in detail and highlight where each of them shines.

**What it feels like to be an open-source maintainer**  
https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/  
Outside your door stands a line of a few hundred people. They are patiently waiting for you to answer their questions, complaints, pull requests, and feature requests. You want to help all of them, but for now you’re putting it off. Maybe you had a hard day at work, or you’re tired, or you’re just trying to enjoy a weekend with your family and friends.

**A Programmer’s Introduction to Unicode**  
http://reedbeta.com/blog/programmers-intro-to-unicode/  
I’m going to focus on the character set and what’s involved in working with strings and files of Unicode text. However, in this article I’m not going to talk about fonts, text layout/shaping/rendering, or localization in detail—those are separate issues, beyond my scope (and knowledge) here.

## 新鲜货

**关于苹果警告**  
http://blog.cnbang.net/internet/3374/  
iOS 开发者们陆续收到苹果邮件，警告去掉动态下发功能，覆盖面很广，内容没有明确指示是什么库，导致大家各种猜测。 其实上周已经有少量用户收到苹果这份警告邮件，当时还以为是特例，现在看来是在灰度测试扫描代码，可见这事苹果应该讨论已久，并专门排期开发测试了扫描程序，直到昨天才正式上线。从各方信息看起来，很不幸主要禁的还是 JSPatch / wax/ rollout 这样的热修复框架，特点是可以通过 JS 脚本调用和替换任意 OC 方法，而像 React Native/ 小程序这样用 JS 做功能的暂时不受影响，Weex 不确定，至于其他库像 AFNetworking / SDWebimage 用到那几个接口的，应该只是误伤。

**Introducing Cloud Functions for Firebase**  
https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/03/introducing-cloud-functions-for-firebase.html

**"💩".length === 2**  
http://blog.jonnew.com/posts/poo-dot-length-equals-two  
Yup, it’s true. In Javascript, "💩".length === 2. You can open up a Chrome debug console, or Node.JS REPL and see for yourself. But why?! And why does '⛳'.length only equal 1?

**New Features in C# 7.0**  
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/09/new-features-in-c-7-0/  
C# 7.0 adds a number of new features and brings a focus on data consumption, code simplification and performance. Perhaps the biggest features are tuples, which make it easy to have multiple results, and pattern matching which simplifies code that is conditional on the shape of data. But there are many other features big and small. We hope that they all combine to make your code more efficient and clear, and you more happy and productive.
