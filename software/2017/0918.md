**Modern Modules - Re-thinking the Node.js ecosystem for modern JavaScript**  
https://medium.com/@mikeal/modern-modules-d99b6867b8f1  
We need to rebuild most of the software infrastructure in the Node.js Ecosystem.
In order to move forward we’re going to have to stop using a lot of the software infrastructure we rely on today but first we need solid alternatives. I’ve started to take this on, as time allows. I’ve already mentioned r2. I’ve also written an async/await bi-directional RPC library called znode.

**How JavaScript works: memory management + how to handle 4 common memory leaks**  
https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-memory-management-how-to-handle-4-common-memory-leaks-3f28b94cfbec  
We’ll discuss another critical topic that’s getting ever more neglected by developers due to the increasing maturity and complexity of programming languages that are being used on a daily basis — memory management. We’ll also provide a few tips on how to handle memory leaks in JavaScript that we at SessionStack follow as we need to make sure SessionStack causes no memory leaks or doesn’t increase the memory consumption of the web app in which we are integrated.

**Understanding & Measuring HTTP Timings with Node.js**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/measuring-http-timings-node-js/  
Understanding and measuring HTTP timings helps us to discover performance bottlenecks in client to server or server to server communication. This article explains timings in an HTTP request and shows how to measure them in Node.js.

这里的后端基础设施主要指的是应用在线上稳定运行需要依赖的关键组件/服务等。开发或者搭建好以上的后端基础设施，一般情况下是能够支撑很长一段时间内的业务的。此外，对于一个完整的架构来说，还有很多应用感知不到的系统基础服务，如负载均衡、自动化部署、系统安全等，并没有包含在本文的描述范围内。

**研发体系这点事**

早在读研究生的时候，自己负责着实验室的项目，就一直在思索如何建立一套简单又高效的研发管理体系，能够在保证项目高质量顺利进行的同时还能够提升团队成员的技术level。后来在自己在校的几次小的创业中，也做过一些尝试。直到毕业后进入前东家，在几个项目的参与过程中，见到了大公司的研发管理是如何进行的。直至加入目前的公司，将研发体系梳理一遍，且学且抄且实践，对这一套东西算是有了一定的实践感悟。

**What I Love and Hate About Flow**  
https://medium.com/@halistechnology/what-i-love-and-hate-about-flow-704835ad087f  
The Good: Eliminate a whole class of errors; Easier refactoring; Helps document things. The Bad: A false sense of security from the misconception that this will have any effect at runtime, More damn errors to fix before your pull request gets merged in, It’s a big time investment. The Verdict: Use Flow (or Typescript) but don’t half-ass it. Go all out and require it in all files. 另附来自 tumblr 的实践： [Flow and TypeScript](https://javascript.tumblr.com/post/165082071937/flow-and-typescript)

**I don’t know who the Web Audio API is designed for**  
http://blog.mecheye.net/2017/09/i-dont-know-who-the-web-audio-api-is-designed-for/  
Web Audio, conversely, is an API I do not understand. The scope of Web Audio is hopelessly huge, with features I can’t imagine anybody using, core abstractions that are hopelessly expensive, and basic functionality basically missing. To quote the specification itself: “It is a goal of this specification to include the capabilities found in modern game audio engines as well as some of the mixing, processing, and filtering tasks that are found in modern desktop audio production applications.” I can’t imagine any game engine or music production app that would want to use any of the advanced features of Web Audio. 附：[Some Opinions On The History Of Web Audio](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/09/some-opinions-on-history-of-web-audio.html)

**Building the DOM faster: speculative parsing, async, defer and preload**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/09/building-the-dom-faster-speculative-parsing-async-defer-and-preload/  
The fresh web standard `<link rel="preload">`, that allows you to load critical resources faster, is coming to Firefox later this month. Understanding what goes on inside a browser is the most powerful tool for every web developer. We’ll look at how browsers interpret your code and how they help you load pages faster with speculative parsing. We’ll break down how defer and async work and how you can leverage the new keyword preload.

**A Brief, Incomplete History of JavaScript**  
https://closebrace.com/articles/2017-09-11/a-brief-incomplete-history-of-javascript  
In 2017, JavaScript development can leave newcomers to the language—and many veterans—paralyzed, unsure of where to begin or which paths are the right ones to take. People often dive into the latest-and-greatest without any real understanding of why it’s so great (or why it might not be). Understanding JavaScript's history can help make sense of its current state.

**What every software engineer should know about search**  
https://medium.com/startup-grind/what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-search-27d1df99f80d  
Numerous current products still have suboptimal search experiences. Any true search expert will tell you that few engineers have a very deep understanding of how search engines work, knowledge that’s often needed to improve search quality.

**Why is Python Growing So Quickly?**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/  
Why is Python growing so fast? Python is used in a variety of purposes, ranging from web development to data science to DevOps, and it’s worth understanding what particular applications of Python have recently become more common. I’m a data scientist who uses R, so I’m certainly interested in how much of Python’s growth has been within my own field. In this post, I’ll take another look at Stack Overflow data to understand what kinds of Python development have been growing, and in what kinds of companies and organizations it’s most used.

**Design Tooling is Still Figuring Itself Out**  
https://css-tricks.com/design-tooling-still-figuring/  
At the moment, there are all kinds of things that design software is struggling to address. The term "screen design" is common, referring to the fact that many of us are designing very specifically for screens, not print or any other application and screens have challenges unique to them. We have different workflows these days than in the past. We have different collaboration needs. We have different technological and economic needs.

**On React and WordPress**  
https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/  
WordPress is to undergo a full rewrite of its ‘Gutenberg’ editor, moving away from using React due to patent ‘baggage’. We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we're always listening. 另附：[如何看待百度要求内部全面停止使用React / React Native](https://www.zhihu.com/question/65437198)

通过学习，你可能会用某种观念或方式来观察这个世界，但是我建议，你们多学习不同人的思想、多考虑不同人的观点。尽量都去尝试一下，然后找出什么是最适合自己的。狐狸不仅从他们认同的观点中获取知识，对于一些他们不同意的观点，狐狸也会说“带走”。狐狸是灵活的。面对挑战时，他们不仅可以做出更好地反应，甚至可以预测到将来可能会遇到什么困难。像富兰克林、莫里、霍珀和许多其他的狐狸一样，你们将以广泛而灵活的方式开拓思维，将学会谨慎地思考，怀疑简单的答案并获得知识。你们将接受磨练，学会如何有效地与他人合作。
