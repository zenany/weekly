**How we do Vue: one year later**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/09/gitlab-vue-one-year-later/  
It's been a while since [we wrote about Vue](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/). Since that last post,  we published [a very extensive Vue style guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vue.html), after which Vue also put out [a style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/), taking inspiration from ours. The style guide has been updated several times as we discover better ways to write Vue. Here are some of the things we discovered.

**Rethinking Android app compilation with Buck**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1894440204217410/rethinking-android-app-compilation-with-buck/  
Several years ago we built and open-sourced Buck, a build tool designed from the ground up for fast iteration, allowing engineers to compile and run changes quickly. We’ve continued to steadily improve Buck’s performance, together with a growing community of other organizations that have adopted Buck and contributed back. But these improvements have largely been incremental in nature and based on long-standing assumptions about the way software development works. In the end, we completely reimagined the way Buck compiles Java code, unlocking performance gains unachievable through incremental improvements. Today we’re open-sourcing a new feature in Buck that will bring these performance improvements to Android engineers everywhere.

**Ten Extras for Great API Documentation**

**在线抓娃娃的基本技术架构**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30825640  
对于开发者来说，从日本红起来的抓娃娃由于其娱乐性、交互性，完全有可能成为下一个国民游戏，或成为泛娱乐产品的标配场景。然而，要抓住在线抓娃娃风口，尽快利用流量变现，需要一整套包含硬件和超低延迟的视频SDK的解决方案。

**Simple React Patterns**  
http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/simple-react-patterns/  
I've been writing React applications for a few years now, and I've noticed that some patterns tend to repeat themselves. In this post, I'll review these patterns which will summarize about 99% of the React code I write every day. As a sample spec, let's build an app that fetches information about the Dagobah planet from Star Wars API and shows it to the user.

**Why we are not cross-platform developers**  
https://android.jlelse.eu/why-we-are-not-cross-platform-developers-fd7ef70e976d  
Here at Pixplicity, where we’ve been making apps for over six years, things are no different: though we started out exclusively as native Android developers before we offered full-spectrum solutions, over the years we’ve tried and tested many of the cross-platform solutions out there, like PhoneGap, Xamarin and React. In the end, we’ve always preferred native solutions for both Android and iOS. Let me try to explain our preference in this post. 另附：[React Native vs Real Native Apps](https://codeburst.io/react-native-vs-real-native-apps-ad890986f1f).

**How The BBC Has Been Trying Out HTTP/2**  
https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/http-2-is-easy-just-turn-it-on-34baad2d1fb1  
The optimisations in h2 make it an attractive proposition for BBC Online, so we ran some simple trials on BBC website content to establish the likely benefits to our audience. 另附：[Enabling Secure HTTP for BBC Online](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/enabling-secure-http-for-bbc-online-media-4c8b597f69f)、[How JavaScript works: Deep dive into WebSockets and HTTP/2 with SSE + how to pick the right path](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-deep-dive-into-websockets-and-http-2-with-sse-how-to-pick-the-right-path-584e6b8e3bf7)

**Creating Secure Password Resets With JSON Web Tokens**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/safe-password-resets-with-json-web-tokens/  
A JWT provides a URL-safe token that, when generated securely, makes for a more secure password-reset process by ensuring that a malicious user cannot easily generate their own token. This article focused on the password-reset process by securing the password-reset flow with a URL-safe token that is validated with a signature. 

**THE MAGIC OF CSS**  
http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/  
CSS is a mess. We all love it, but it’s a mess. I liken it to English: there are a bunch of rules, and you can learn them. But sometimes you’re better off just trying shit and seeing what works and what doesn’t. Magic is a codification of what I’ve learned in that crazy process. The material in this textbook is intermediate-to-advanced. It assumes an understanding of the CSS syntax, cascading and inheritance, and commonly used selectors. It also assumes you’ve had enough experience with CSS to have learned not to make these common mistakes anymore.

**An Update on Reddit’s Redesign**  
https://redditblog.com/2017/11/08/an-update-on-reddits-redesign/  
Well, ten months and several rounds of user and moderator testing later, we’re excited to share  the very first look at the upcoming redesign. While we still have lots of improvements to the UI, feature set, and moderation flow still in the works, we’re excited to start by sharing a preview of two of the most important features in the redesign: a new set of community styling tools and an easier way for users to post to their favorite communities.

**Creating a Star to Heart Animation with SVG and Vanilla JavaScript**  
https://css-tricks.com/creating-star-heart-animation-svg-vanilla-javascript/  
In [my previous article](https://css-tricks.com/emulating-css-timing-functions-javascript/), I've shown how to smoothly transition from one state to another using vanilla JavaScript. The last example showcased making the shape of a mouth to go from sad to glad by changing the d attribute of the path we used to draw this mouth. Manipulating the path data can be taken to the next level to give us more interesting results, like a star morphing into a heart.

**Simple Tips to Improve User Testing**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/simple-tips-to-improve-user-testing/  
Usability testing involves observing users as they use a product. It helps you find where users struggle and what they like. There are two ways to run a usability test: Moderated, in which a moderator works with a test participant; Unmoderated, in which the test participant completes the test alone. We’ll focus on the first, but some of the tips mentioned can be applied to both types of testing.

**Feature Visualization**  
https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/

We had reached a broad set of features that make up Prometheus' simple yet extremely powerful monitoring philosophy. Since then we added and improved on various service discovery integrations, extended PromQL, and experimented with a first iteration on remote APIs to enable pluggable long-term storage solutions. But what else has changed to merit a new major release?

一个人真正的成长，就是不断自我进化。这也是《原则》这本书最核心的思想。一个人最大的障碍就是自己。这障碍，不是人本身，其实是思维。改造思维的关键是让自己成为一个shaper。如果把人看成一个独立的生命体，当生命处于1.0阶段，它开始产生信息交换与流动；当生命处于2.0阶段时，它就能成为一个对自己的生命进行自我改变的shaper。自我进化并不是一件轻松的事情。它有非常多的障碍，其中最大的障碍就是ego（自我）。
