**Front-End Developer Handbook 2018**  
https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/
This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2018. The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.

**JavaScript and Node.js Security – The Common Pitfalls**  
https://snyk.io//blog/javascript-and-nodejs-security-the-common-pitfalls/
JavaScript and Node.js have shown themselves to be amazing platforms. Their sheer ease of use has empowered an entire community of creative individuals to build amazing things. Like in all cases, however, amongst the goodness lurk some risks. Nobody’s perfect, including Node.js and JavaScript, and a language’s strength can quickly translate to its vulnerability if looked through through an evil (or paranoid) lens. I’ve given many talks about JavaScript security, looking to do my share in raising awareness and to keep our applications safer. 另附：[Attitudes to security in the JavaScript community](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/172774747080/attitudes-to-security-in-the-javascript-community), [Incident Post-Mortem and Security Advisory: Data Exposure After travis-ci.com Outage](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-04-03-incident-post-mortem)

**Looking to Listen: Audio-Visual Speech Separation**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/looking-to-listen-audio-visual-speech.html
People are remarkably good at focusing their attention on a particular person in a noisy environment, mentally “muting” all other voices and sounds. Known as the cocktail party effect, this capability comes natural to us humans. However, automatic speech separation — separating an audio signal into its individual speech sources — while a well-studied problem, remains a significant challenge for computers. 另附：[谷歌发布「与书对话」检索引擎，从字里行间邂逅心仪书籍](https://www.leiphone.com/news/201804/mGWpse2M8Fnn5Vcs.html)

**Why SQLite Does Not Use Git**  
https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html
SQLite does not use the Git version control system. SQLite uses Fossil instead, which is a version control system that was specifically designed and written to support SQLite. People sometimes ask why SQLite does not use the Git version control system like everybody else. This article attempts to answer that question. Also, in section 3, this article provides hints to Git users about how they can easily access the SQLite source code.

**GitHub 10 years**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-04-10-ten-years-of-code/
On this day 10 years ago, GitHub officially went live. We started with a pretty simple purpose: to connect developers and make it easier for them to work together on projects with Git. In the last decade, we’ve evolved as a company and as a platform, but the reason why GitHub exists is fundamentally the same. What makes this platform special isn’t an idea or an invention. It’s the people using it—and GitHub is celebrating 10 years because of you, our community.

**How To Design Emotional Interfaces For Boring Apps**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-emotional-interfaces-boring-apps/
Humans can’t endure boredom for a long time, which is why products that are built for non-exciting, repetitive tasks so often get abandoned and gather dust on computers and phones. But boredom, according to psychologists, is merely lack of stimulation, the unfulfilled desire for satisfying activity. So what if we use the interface to give them that stimulation? I sat with product designers here at MacPaw, who spend their waking hours designing not-so-sexy things like duplicate finders and encryption apps, and they shared five secrets to more emotional UIs: gamification, humor, animation, illustration, and mascots.

**Brutalist design is the bad influence we all need**  
https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/why-we-need-web-brutalism/
The UX/UI world has gradually come to be dominated by guidelines and aesthetics belonging to companies like Apple or Google. It’s absolutely normal and predictable that this would happen, considering most apps are designed to seamlessly fit into the user experience of technologies belonging to these big titans.

**Top 3 Things Charter Learned About Reusable Designs and Components**  
https://blog.angular.io/top-3-things-charter-learned-about-reusable-designs-and-components-dd367de32122
Modern web app development is complicated. Even when you go it alone, you’re faced with innumerable decisions. Which libraries and frameworks will you choose? How will you structure your code? What syntax rules will you follow? How will you build and deploy the app?

**Color: From Hexcodes to Eyeballs**  
http://jamie-wong.com/post/color/
Why do we perceive background-color: #9B51E0 as this particular purple? This is one of those questions where I thought I’d known the answer for a long time, but as I inspected my understanding, I realized there were pretty significant gaps. Through an exploration of electromagnetic radiation, optical biology, colorimetry, and display hardware, I hope to start filling in some of these gaps.

https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/
THE MODERN WEB contains no shortage of horrors, from ubiquitous ad trackers to all-consuming platforms to YouTube comments, generally. Unfortunately, there's no panacea for what ails this internet we've built. But anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that's been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It's time to head back to RSS. 另附：[RSS is undead](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/).

Fear and hatred have no place when you make such a simple and friendly gesture to someone else. So come join me, and make some new friends. Say hello, and love your world.

**How To Be a Systems Thinker**  
https://www.edge.org/conversation/mary_catherine_bateson-how-to-be-a-systems-thinker
At the moment, I’m asking myself how people think about complex wholes like the ecology of the planet, or the climate, or large populations of human beings that have evolved for many years in separate locations and are now re-integrating. To think about these things, I find that you need something like systems theory. So, I went back to thinking about systems theory two or three years ago, which I hadn’t for quite a long time.

**[译]增长黑客 VS 价值黑客**  
http://36kr.com/p/5128132.html
专注于一个指标，并试图不惜一切代价将其提高，是实现增长的合理途径吗？在工程师拉杰德拉 · 拉斯马纳（Rajendra Rusmana）看来，这种做法偏离了产品的本质——为用户提供价值。按照这种方式去推动增长，必然会到达瓶颈，因为增长黑客本质上是一个最优化问题。为了突破这个瓶颈，应该将目光转移到价值上，成为一个价值黑客。
