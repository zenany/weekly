**16 Best Practices for Shared UI Libraries**  
https://blog.newrelic.com/2018/03/15/best-practices-shared-ui-libraries/  
Recently, the New Relic Core UI team moved to React v16.0. In support of this move, we’ve had to upgrade a handful of shared UI libraries owned by teams across the company. As most of us know, upgrading cross-company dependencies can be quite the challenge, and it takes a lot of time. Often, during such work, we find that UI libraries are not always in the best shape for sharing. To that end, I’ve put together this list of some best practices and recommendations for building shareable UI libraries.

https://eng.uber.com/uber-kiosk/  
One influence for the Uber kiosk came from arcade games, which, compared to a PC at home, creates a social environment inviting others to help the primary user. That attribute, along with a live support representative, brings in a human element we wanted to highlight. After initial success in supporting and signing up driver partners through our kiosk prototype program, we are looking at new uses, building on Uber’s core value of leveraging the digital world to enrich people’s experiences in the physical.
