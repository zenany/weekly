**Who Left Open The Cookie Jar?**  
https://wholeftopenthecookiejar.eu/  
As browsers have become enormously complex, certain edge-cases may have been overlooked or the interplay of specific features may have unwanted side-effects. In our research, we created a framework to verify whether all imposed cookie- and request-policies are correctly applied (will be made available soon). Worryingly, we found that most mechanisms could be circumvented: for instance for all ad-blocking and anti-tracking browser extensions we discovered at least one technique that could bypass the policies. For the technical details of these findings, we invite you to [read our paper](https://wholeftopenthecookiejar.eu/static/tpc-paper.pdf), which was presented at [USENIX Security ’18](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18).

**Embedded builtins**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/08/embedded-builtins.html  
V8 built-in functions (builtins) consume memory in every instance of V8. The builtin count, average size, and the number of V8 instances per Chrome browser tab have been growing significantly. This blog post describes how we reduced the median V8 heap size per website by 19% over the past year.

**JavaScript engine fundamentals: optimizing prototypes**  
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/prototypes  
This article describes some key fundamentals that are common to all JavaScript engines — and not just V8, the engine the authors (Benedikt and Mathias) work on. As a JavaScript developer, having a deeper understanding of how JavaScript engines work helps you reason about the performance characteristics of your code. 

**Keep Betting on JavaScript by Kyle Simpson**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDLQA6lQSFg  
"Always bet on JavaScript", revels in JS's history of naysayers predicting that we'd eventually reach a point where JS couldn't grow to meet the demands of modern development; it turns out those have always been bad bets. It's safe to say JS is no longer trying to prove itself. It has arrived.

**Principles of Modern Application Development**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/principles-of-modern-application-development/  
These principles can be summarized as keep it small, design for the developer, and make it networked. With these three principles, you can design a robust, complex application that can be delivered quickly and securely, scaled easily, and extended simply.

**The 10:1 rule of writing and programming**  
https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2018/08/12/the-10-to-1-rule-of-writing-and-programming/  
Give that my data set is limited, I can only draw a few preliminary conclusions: The ratio of “raw materials” to “finished product” in a book is roughly 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time an editor asks you for a timeline! If you want to write a 300 page book, you’ll probably have to write around 3,000 pages. Similarly, the ratio of “code churn” to “lines of code” in mature and non-trivial software is also at least 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time a manager or customer asks you for a time estimate! To build a 10,000 line app, expect to write roughly 100,000 lines. These can be summarized as what I shall dub the 10:1 rule of writing and programming: Good software and good writing requires that every line has been rewritten, on average, at least 10 times.

**前端下半场：构建跨框架的 UI 库**  
https://www.phodal.com/blog/build-cross-framework-ui-library/  
跨框架的 UI 库，即前端 UI 库可以不经任何修改，直接能运行在 React、Angular、Vue 等框架上。

**微前端的设计理念与实践初探**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41879781  
微服务与微前端，都是希望将某个单一的单体应用，转化为多个可以独立运行、独立开发、独立部署、独立维护的服务或者应用的聚合，从而满足业务快速变化及分布式多团队并行开发的需求。如康威定律(Conway’s Law)所言，设计系统的组织，其产生的设计和架构等价于组织间的沟通结构；微服务与微前端不仅仅是技术架构的变化，还包含了组织方式、沟通方式的变化。 

**聊聊Web中的度数单位**  
https://www.w3cplus.com/css/understanding-degrees-on-the-web.html  
在现实世界中，度数几乎是测量角度的单位。它在Web中同样是一个受欢迎的角色，也适用于我们将遇到的各种场景。幸运的是，在现实世界中的度数和虚拟世界中的度数有很多相似之处，所以在这篇文章中将来学习一些有关于度数相关的知识，然后深入了解一些细节。

**漫谈前端性能 突破 React 应用瓶颈**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/42032897  
性能一直以来是前端开发中非常重要的话题。随着前端能做的事情越来越多，浏览器能力被无限放大和利用：从 web 游戏到复杂单页面应用，从 NodeJS 服务到 web VR/AR、数据可视化，前端工程师总是在突破极限。随之而来的性能问题有的被迎刃而解，有的成为难以逾越的盾墙。那么，当我们在谈论性能时，到底在说什么？基于 React 框架开发的应用，在性能上又有哪些特点？这篇文章我们从浏览器和 JavaScript 引擎角度来剖析前端性能，同时创新 React，充分利用浏览器能力突破局限。

**洞察 video 超能力系列——玩转 flv**  
https://techblog.toutiao.com/2018/08/13/untitled-52/  
flv的全程是 Flash Video，顾名思义，就是专门给flash播放器提供的播放格式，这种格式具有结构简单、清晰的优点，最早出现是为了解决flash导出的swf文件体积过大，不适合在web中播放的问题。随着flash的逐渐淘汰，新的video标签自然是不支持flv格式的，人们开始把web视频的重点放在mp4或者hls上，但是随着直播这种视频形式的火热兴起，flv迎来了新一轮的生机。

**Simple internationalization of React apps**  
https://itnext.io/simple-internationalization-of-react-apps-34b3bda95725  
react-intl is still a standard when it comes to i18n of React apps. Even though it haven’t been maintained for about a year, the community is so strong that it’s gaining on popularity and new independent tools are constantly being published. I would like to introduce you to alternative i18n solution I’ve been working on for the last year and a half — [jsLingui](https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui). The low-level API is very similar to react-intl to make migration of my projects easier, but on top of that there’s a completely different developer experience.

**Creating a Chrome extension in 2018: The good, the bad and the meh**  
https://checklyhq.com/blog/2018/08/creating-a-chrome-extension-in-2018-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/  
We shipped an initial version of [Puppeteer Recorder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/puppeteer-recorder/djeegiggegleadkkbgopoonhjimgehda), a Google Chrome extension that records your browser interactions and generates a Puppeteer script. It turns out Chrome extension development is almost like real web development, but with a weird dash of quasi embedded development mixed in. This post talks you through the development lifecycle when creating an extension and lists some of the architectural gotcha’s. Source code for the extension in question is on github.

**Browser painting and considerations for web performance**  
https://css-tricks.com/browser-painting-and-considerations-for-web-performance/  
In this article, I'd like to focus on the last part: painting. All of those steps combined is a lot of work for a browser to do on load... and actually, not just on load, but any time the DOM (or CSSOM) is changed. That’s why many web developers tend to partially solve this by using some sort of frontend framework, such as React which, apart from many other advantages, can help to highly optimize changes in the DOM to avoid unnecessary recalculating or rendering.

**Creating the “Perfect” CSS System**  
https://medium.com/gusto-design/creating-the-perfect-css-system-fa38f5bcdd9e

**Cross-tab Synchronization with the Web Locks API**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2018/08/14/cross-tab-synchronization-with-the-web-locks-api/  
The Web Locks API is a new addition to the Web Platform which allows you to execute JavaScript in a lock, a resource which can potentially get shared with other browser tabs. Use cases which are suitable for the Web Locks API are the managing, coordinating, and syncing of multi-tab interactions. Currently, some or all of the Shared Web Worker, Broadcast Channel, Local Storage, Session Storage, Post Message & unload handler APIs can be used to manage tab communication and synchronization, however, they each have their drawbacks and require workarounds which decrease code maintainability.

**Shadow DOM in Ionic (and Why it’s Awesome)**  
https://blog.ionicframework.com/shadow-dom-in-ionic-and-why-its-awesome/  
I’d like to think we here at Ionic know a thing or two about Shadow DOM, as we recently made the move to using it in Ionic 4, and with that, received a lot of questions from the community on just what the heck it is. There’s a lot of information (and misinformation) floating around about Shadow DOM, so let’s go through the API and see what it actually does.

**WebAssembly: How and why**

**Dweb: Building a Resilient Web with WebTorrent**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/08/dweb-building-a-resilient-web-with-webtorrent/  
The web is healthy when the financial cost of self-expression isn’t a barrier. In this installment of the Dweb series we’ll learn about WebTorrent – an implementation of the BitTorrent protocol that runs in web browsers. This approach to serving files means that websites can scale with as many users as are simultaneously viewing the website – removing the cost of running centralized servers at data centers.

**Introducing headless Chrome support in Cloud Functions and App Engine**  
https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-headless-chrome-support-in-cloud-functions-and-app-engine  
We're pleased to announce that the Google Cloud Functions and Cloud Functions for Firebase Node.js 8 runtimes have also been upgraded with the OS packages required to run headless Chrome. This means that you can now author Cloud Functions that use headless Chrome---and utilize all the features of a web browser in a fully serverless environment. Headless Chrome lets you take advantage of the modern web platform features from Chromium and the Blink rendering engine too. 另附：[Puppeteer 1.7 Released](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

**Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233  
Notebooks have rapidly grown in popularity among data scientists to become the de facto standard for quick prototyping and exploratory analysis. At Netflix, we’re pushing the boundaries even further, reimagining what a notebook can be, who can use it, and what they can do with it. And we’re making big investments to help make this vision a reality. In this post, we’ll share our motivations and why we find Jupyter notebooks so compelling. We’ll also introduce components of our notebook infrastructure and explore some of the novel ways we’re using notebooks at Netflix.

**Maximizing Process Performance with Maze, Uber’s Funnel Visualization Platform**  
https://eng.uber.com/maze/  
By applying Maze to the logs captured during driver sign-up, we can visualize the actual paths drivers take when signing up with Uber, and identify bottlenecks that occur in the process. Maze’s application at Uber has since expanded beyond the sign-up use case, and it is now used to visualize many processes—from rider pick-up and drop-off to user interactions with our website. Read on to learn how the Uber Visualization team developed Maze and why this new solution offers unparalleled insight into the Uber user experience.

**E-Commerce at Scale: Inside Shopify's Tech Stack**  
https://shopifyengineering.myshopify.com/blogs/engineering/e-commerce-at-scale-inside-shopifys-tech-stack  
Shopify is a multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium businesses that lets you create a shop and sell products wherever you want: online via web store or social media and offline with a POS card reader. Shopify powers 600K merchants and serves 80K requests per second at peak. While helping aspiring entrepreneurs to launch their stores, Shopify also holds some of the world's largest sales for the Super Bowl, Kylie Cosmetics, and celebrities like Justin Bieber and Kanye West. These "flash sales" are tricky from an engineering point of view because of their unpredictably large volumes of traffic.

**Cost of a Join**  
https://www.brianlikespostgres.com/  
It depends! It depends what the join criteria is, what indexes are present, how big the tables are, whether the relations are cached, what hardware is being used, what configuration parameters are set, whether statistics are up-to-date, what other activity is happening on the system, to name a few things.

**Universal Method to Sort Complex Information Found**  
https://www.quantamagazine.org/universal-method-to-sort-complex-information-found-20180813/  
The nearest neighbor problem asks where a new point fits into an existing data set. A few researchers set out to prove that there was no universal way to solve it. Instead, they found such a way.

**Dijkstra's in Disguise**  
https://blog.evjang.com/2018/08/dijkstras.html  
Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Johnson's, Floyd-Warshall are good algorithms for solving the shortest paths problem. This blog post is a gentle tutorial on how all these varied CS topics are connected. No prior knowledge of finance, reinforcement learning, or computer graphics is needed. The reader should be familiar with undergraduate probability theory, introductory calculus, and be willing to look at some math equations. I've also sprinkled in some insights and questions that might be interesting to the AI research audience, so hopefully there's something for everybody here. 另附：[The Total Beginner's Guide to Game AI](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/artificial-intelligence/the-total-beginners-guide-to-game-ai-r4942/).

**Preventing downloading images or objects until they are visible in the viewport**  
https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2806  
One solution to this is to have an attribute for declaring which images or objects should not be downloaded and decoded until they are visible in the viewport. For example,  `<img lazyload>.*.` Alternatively, a meta element could be placed in the head to globally set all images and objects to only download once they are visible in the viewport.

**全面反思腾讯的战略**  
https://36kr.com/p/5148266.html  
看待腾讯，有很多视角，今天我用的是数据与算法这个视角。数据与算法，以我对两者重要性的理解，我觉得是对一家互联网公司运营最高维度的抽象，这个视角过滤掉了许多喧嚣的表面因素和大量无关紧要的细枝末节，因而有可能是最接近本质的。我认为，从数据与算法的角度看，一个公司从小到大的进化过程，无非是在做两件事情，一是升级算法处理数据，二是获取更多的数据，而在这两方面，腾讯都做得不够好，它未来的进化之路就会困难重重。
