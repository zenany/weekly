**You Don’t Need Redux, MobX, RxJS, Cerebral**  
https://medium.com/@foxdonut00/you-dont-need-redux-mobx-rxjs-cerebral-6a735b150a02  
For state management, try this simple pattern instead of a library
Don’t get me wrong. Those libraries are great. But I’m suggesting a different, unique approach. I know what you’re thinking: Redux alternatives are a dime a dozen. But this isn’t yet another library. In fact, it’s not a library at all. It’s just a simple pattern: Meiosis.

**React Suite v3.0 正式版发布**  
http://div.io/topic/2200

**Reported malicious module: getcookies**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173526807575/reported-malicious-module-getcookies  
Early May 2nd, the npm security team received and responded to reports of a package that masqueraded as a cookie parsing library but contained a malicious backdoor. The result of the investigation concluded with three packages and three versions of a fourth package being unpublished from the npm Registry.

**A Guide To The State Of Print Stylesheets In 2018**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/print-stylesheets-in-2018/  
This article will explore how we can best create that second experience. We will take a look at how we should include print styles in our web pages, and look at the specifications that really come into their own once printing. We’ll find out about the state of browser support, and how to best test our print styles. I’ll then give you some pointers as to what to do when a print stylesheet isn’t enough for your printing needs.

**How fast can you parse JSON?**  
https://lemire.me/blog/2018/05/03/how-fast-can-you-parse-json/  
n a recent paper by Microsoft ([Mison: A Fast JSON Parser for Data Analytics](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1118-li.pdf)), the researchers report parsing JSON document at 0.1 or 0.2 GB/s with common libraries such as RapidJSON. It is hard to tell the exact number as you need to read a tiny plot, but I have the right ballpark. They use a 3.5 GHz processor, so that’s 8 to 16 cycles per input byte of data.

**Previewing Elasticsearch 6.3 SQL Feature**  
https://medium.com/@mustafaakin/previewing-elasticsearch-6-3-sql-feature-2d3a1d60cab4

X-Pack contains APM, Canvas, and most importantly (to me at least) the SQL support. 另附：[TiDB 2.0 is Ready - Faster, Smarter, and Battle-Tested](https://pingcap.com/blog/tidb-2-0-announcement/), [eBay Open Sources 'The Accelerator', a Fast Data Processing Tool](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/announcing-the-accelerator-processing-1-000-000-000-lines-per-second-on-a-single-computer/).

**Learning from Source Code**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/learning-source-code/  
Program analysis in the past has largely focused on either the formal, machine-interpretable semantics of programs or it has viewed programs as a (somewhat odd) instance of natural language. Approaches from the former are rooted in mathematical logic and require extensive engineering effort for every new case that needs to be handled. On the other hand, natural language approaches involve applications of natural language processing tools that work well on purely syntactic tasks but so far have not been able to learn semantics of programs. In a new paper presented at ICLR 2018, researchers from Microsoft Research and from Simon Fraser University Vancouver present a new way to combine these two worlds and show how to find bugs in released software.

**Open-sourcing gVisor, a sandboxed container runtime**  
https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/05/Open-sourcing-gVisor-a-sandboxed-container-runtime.html  
We’d like to introduce [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor), a new kind of sandbox that helps provide secure isolation for containers, while being more lightweight than a virtual machine (VM). gVisor integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple and easy to run sandboxed containers in production environments. 另附：[Introducing .app, a more secure home for apps on the web](https://www.blog.google/topics/developers/introducing-app-more-secure-home-apps-web/), [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)、[Introducing the Operator Framework: Building Apps on Kubernetes](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework)、[Twitter - A new collaboration with Google Cloud](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2018/a-new-collaboration-with-google-cloud.html).

**Introducing Elmstatic: an Elm-to-HTML static site generator**  
https://korban.net/posts/elm/2018-05-03-introducing-elmstatic-elm-static-site-generator/  
I've been using Elm to generate this site for a few months. It's still highly experimental and incomplete but I hope that other Elm enthusiasts may find it useful. At the moment, it works for my needs and allows me to generate this site with a single command, but it requires manual intervention if I'm doing things like deleting pages or adding new Elm dependencies, and I'm sure there are many use cases it doesn't address. I think I have something barebones but useful so I published it on NPM under the name of Elmstatic.

**The Ultimate Guide to Font Sizes in UI Design**  
https://learnui.design/blog/ultimate-guide-font-sizes-ui-design.html  
One of the most common questions I receive from beginning UI designers is: what font size should I use for my project? Sometimes they’re asking about a website, sometimes an Android app, sometimes iPhone/iPad. And you know? I empathize. Material Design has nice guidelines, but they’re like 50 pages long. iOS… well, they don’t even have nice guidelines! And the web is (still) the wild west. Maybe some article pops up – whoa, new sheriff in town – and tells you what font sizes to use based on some dark magic involving the golden ratio, but come on people.

腾讯正在丧失产品能力和创业精神，变成一家投资公司。这家快20岁的公司正在变得功利和短视，他的强项不再是产品业务，而是投资财技 。3Q大战过后这8年，腾讯刀枪入库马放南山，以流量和资本为核心动能，走上了开放投资道路。但与此同时，公司逐步失去了内部的产品和创新能力，在搜索/微博/电商/信息流/短视频/云等核心战场不断溃败。另附：[燕雀安知腾讯（hóng hú）之志](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NzYxMzk4MQ==&mid=2649331147&idx=1&sn=ec02555ce6704e6260125cfb29c5afe9)、[还在被低估的阿里](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NzY2OTE2MQ==&mid=2652218670&idx=1&sn=49b0cfc7213ea15d6e08ea532f348bb0)、[腾讯发布“00后画像报告” 颠覆我们对这一代的认知](https://www.toutiao.com/i6552284076290605582/)、[腾讯到底有没有梦想](https://baijia.baidu.com/topic?topic_id=817)
