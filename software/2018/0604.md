## 深阅读

**deno**  
https://github.com/ry/deno  
A secure TypeScript runtime on V8. Node 创始人新作，基于 Go 语言. Supports TypeScript 2.8 out of the box. Uses V8 6.8.275.3. That is, it's very modern JavaScript. No package.json, no npm. Not explicitly compatible with Node. Imports reference source code URLs only.

**Why is Front-End Development So Unstable?**  
https://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2018/05/why-is-front-end-development-so-unstable/   
Like most natural complainers I am generally better at moaning about problems than, y’know, SOLVING them. But I have a few ideas: Be wary of Medium; Be wary of self-promotion; Consider non-microlib architectures; Don’t over-sweat the employablity thing.

**Andrew Clark: React Suspense**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6JC0_cOns  
Async rendering in React gives us a powerful new set of primitives for addressing longstanding problems in UI development. I'll discuss React's vision for how async rendering can improve data fetching, code delivery, prefetching, view transitions, and more. 另：[It's 5 Years Since React Was Open Sourced](https://twitter.com/reactjs/status/1001521260482904064)、[Let’s fall in love with React Fiber](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-fall-in-love-with-react-fiber-90f2e1f68ded)

**To Yarn and Back (to npm) Again**  
https://mixmax.com/blog/to-yarn-and-back-again-npm  
Last year, we decided to move all of our JavaScript projects from npm to Yarn. Yarn solved the annoying problems we faced using npm, but it came with issues of its own. After a couple of especially painful weeks full of 15-minute Yarn untangling sessions, we decided to take a look at moving back to npm.

**Beyond SPAs: alternative architectures for your PWA**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/beyond-spa  
I'm going to cover an important, but potentially misunderstood topic: The architecture that you use for your web app, and specifically, how your architectural decisions come into play when you're building a progressive web app. 另附：[New in Chrome 67](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/nic67)、[enable Shadow DOM in Nightly](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1460069)  

**The Cult of the Complex**  
http://alistapart.com/article/cult-of-the-complex  
There’s a lot of complexity to good design. Technical complexity. UX complexity. Challenges of content and microcopy. Performance challenges. This has never been and never will be an easy job. Simplicity is not easy—not for us, anyway. Simplicity means doing the hard work that makes experiences appear seamless—the sweat and torture-testing and failure that eventually, with enough effort, yields experiences that seem to “just work.”

**如何用练习快速提升技术**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652975915&idx=1&sn=1d0c3bb0937e3d9cf1f74b1257c7aacc  
有人可以靠中彩票，然后一夜暴富；有人随随便便发几张自拍，就一不小心一夜成名。可技术成长，要一步一个脚印地练习，才能掌握某项特定技术。等到我们掌握了学习的技巧，才能用更短的时间，来掌握某项特定的技术。而练习，也不是一天里写一万行代码，也不是重复写一百行代码，而是在一百天里，每天写下一百行代码。它需要一定的技巧，不懈的坚持，还有一些休息。因此在这篇文章里，我将分享工作几年里的练习技巧。

**浅谈 2018 移动端跨平台开发方案**  
https://juejin.im/post/5b076e3af265da0dce48fe95

**头条PC站基于RIOT的组件化开发实践**  
https://techblog.toutiao.com/2018/05/29/untitled-25/  
[Riotjs](https://github.com/riot/riot)是一种小而美的js框架，2.2.4稳定版本兼容IE8。采用该框架在头条pc站进行了组件化开发方式的实践，有效地提高了开发效率和扩展能力，并大大降低了维护成本。

大前端已经是Web前端和客户端开发的趋势，加上Node的横空出世，移动端设备提升、HTML5能力加强，移动和前端的融合也已不可逆转。在如此多变的技术浪潮下，作为一个前端人，该如何辨识清楚技术的发展方向，又该怎么学习呢？

**淘宝Web 3D应用与游戏开发**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxNDEwNjk5OQ==&mid=2650401461&idx=1&sn=695615d75dc2409ac0f461c7fd55710e

**CSS Is So Overpowered It Can Deanonymize Facebook Users**  
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/css-is-so-overpowered-it-can-deanonymize-facebook-users/  
Some of the recent additions to the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) web standard are so powerful that a security researcher has abused them to deanonymize visitors to a demo site and reveal their Facebook usernames, avatars, and if they liked a particular web page of Facebook.

**Reconciling GraphQL and Thrift at Airbnb**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/reconciling-graphql-and-thrift-at-airbnb-a97e8d290712  
Our frontend engineers wanted rapid iteration and flexibility from GraphQL, while our backend engineers wanted stability and specificity from Thrift. This is the story of how we got the two groups talking and built something that works for everyone. 另附：[Prisma Aims to Unite the Polyglot of Databases with GraphQL](https://thenewstack.io/prisma-aims-to-unite-the-polyglot-of-databases-with-graphql/)

**A cartoon intro to DNS over HTTPS**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/05/a-cartoon-intro-to-dns-over-https/  
Two more protections we’re adding to that list are: DNS over HTTPS, a new IETF standards effort that we’ve championed; Trusted Recursive Resolver, a new secure way to resolve DNS that we’ve partnered with Cloudflare to provide. With these two initiatives, we’re closing data leaks that have been part of the domain name system since it was created 35 years ago. And we’d like your help in testing them. So let’s look at how DNS over HTTPS and Trusted Recursive Resolver protect our users. But first, let’s look at how web pages move around the Internet.

**UTC is Enough for Everyone, Right?**
https://zachholman.com/talk/utc-is-enough-for-everyone-right  
Programming time, dates, timezones, recurring events, leap seconds... everything is pretty terrible. The common refrain in the industry is Just use UTC! Just use UTC! And that's correct... sort of. But if you're stuck building software that deals with time, there's so much more to consider. It's time... to talk about time.

**Bad Practices in Database Design: Are You Making These Mistakes?**

**10 GitHub Security Best Practices**  
https://snyk.io//blog/ten-git-hub-security-best-practices/  
So let’s get started with our list of 10 GitHub security best practices, starting with the classic mistake of people adding their passwords into their GitHub repositories!

**How the Go runtime implements maps efficiently (without generics)**  
https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics  
This post discusses how maps are implemented in Go.

**A new fast hash table in response to Google’s new fast hash table**  
https://probablydance.com/2018/05/28/a-new-fast-hash-table-in-response-to-googles-new-fast-hash-table/  
I wrote my new favorite hash table. This came about because last year I wrote the fastest hash table (I still make that claim) and this year one of the organizers of the C++Now conference asked me to give a talk. My problem was that Google had also announced a new fast hash table last year, and I wasn’t sure if mine would compare well against theirs.

**How to Create a Team-Health Assessment for Engineering Organizations**  
https://blog.newrelic.com/2018/05/29/team-health-assessment/  
Talking with folks in various leadership roles at New Relic, I heard a lot of stories about the successes and failures of this new model. But it was all anecdotes, it wasn’t real data. We needed something more concrete if we wanted to understand what was going on in these new teams and drive the positive changes we wanted to make. At the same time I was having these conversations, the Agile Fluency Project released an agile practices diagnostic for teams, and the proverbial light bulb appeared: We needed to do team health assessments. This is the story of how we developed and implemented our assessments.

**30 years later, QBasic is still the best**  
http://www.nicolasbize.com/blog/30-years-later-qbasic-is-still-the-best/  
My quest has led me to endless forums, through which I have tried countless suggestions: SmallBasic, Pico-8, Smalltalk, Scratch, etc. I have even inquired of the Great Oracles of StackOverflow, to no avail. After 5 months, I ended up with a disappointing conclusion: nothing is even close to what I had back in another era. 30 years later, QBasic is still the best when it comes to discovering programming. 另附：[少儿编程图鉴，你会让孩子学Coding吗](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651007591&idx=1&sn=deab03f3f0ecc3e34901a73aa1c113b2)

**Getting Started with Live Coding in Visual Studio Code w/ Live Share**  
https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-live-coding-in-visual-studio-code-with-live-share  
Live Share is an extension for VS Code that enables real-time collaboration between developers. As you'll see in a second, you'll have the ability to share a "session" with someone else, allowing them to edit code as well as share a sever and debugging session. I've seen real-time collaboration in action with Cloud 9 before, but to have this now be a part of my favorite text editor is extremely exciting! So, let's go ahead and take a look at how it works.

一方面我们说教育改变命运，但又发现出现了“教育无用论”。有人说教育一定是出了问题。问题是出在学校社会家长，还是出在学生呢？这些原因可能都有，但更重要的可能是我们需要从另外一个角度和眼光来看待这个问题。
