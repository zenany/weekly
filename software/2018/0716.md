**Postmortem for Malicious Packages Published**  
https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes  
On July 12th, 2018, an attacker compromised the npm account of an ESLint maintainer and published malicious versions of the eslint-scope and eslint-config-eslint packages to the npm registry. On installation, the malicious packages downloaded and executed code from pastebin.com which sent the contents of the user’s .npmrc file to the attacker. An .npmrc file typically contains access tokens for publishing to npm. 附：[How to revoke npm tokens and clear node_modules recursively after eslint-scope hack](https://gist.github.com/localjo/59bb12b7a4789e01e3782cf8a1031c87)、[Incident report: npm, Inc. operations incident of July 12, 2018](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175824896885/incident-report-npm-inc-operations-incident-of)、[ESLint backdoor: revoke all the tokens](https://blog.sqreen.io/eslint-backdoor/)、[Two-factor authentication protection for packages](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175861857230/two-factor-authentication-protection-for-packages).

**Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar**  
https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/  
In early 2017 we reached a tipping point with a core piece of Segment’s product. It seemed as if we were falling from the microservices tree, hitting every branch on the way down. Instead of enabling us to move faster, the small team found themselves mired in exploding complexity. Essential benefits of this architecture became burdens. As our velocity plummeted, our defect rate exploded. Eventually, the team found themselves unable to make headway, with 3 full-time engineers spending most of their time just keeping the system alive. Something had to change. This post is the story of how we took a step back and embraced an approach that aligned well with our product requirements and needs of the team.  另附：[Newsround, nanoservices and serverless](https://medium.com/bbc-design-engineering/newsround-nanoservices-and-serverless-75e50b0329a0).

**Service Mesh and the Promise of Istio**  
https://thenewstack.io/service-mesh-and-the-promise-of-istio/  
In a microservices environment, neither of these options is ideal. The application overlay approach is application aware and can perform sophisticated content-based routing, but it will lead to a large amount of redundant code in each service and potentially a lower performance. Conversely, relying on traditional L3 or L4 networking means that it has neither the concept nor the visibility of service requests, which are critical to making optimal routing decisions. This is why service mesh is so appealing for the microservice environment — it operates at the L7 level, but is separate from the application code and can enforce L3/L4 policies with app-level insight. To understand this point, we must first dig into the architecture of service mesh.

**Thank You for Your Help NoSQL, but We Got It from Here**

**Javascript Framework Comparison with Examples (React, Vue & Hyperapp)**  
https://hackernoon.com/javascript-framework-comparison-with-examples-react-vue-hyperapp-97f064fb468d  
In my [previous article](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-framework-comparison-with-examples-react-vue-hyperapp-97f064fb468d), I tried to explain why I think Hyperapp is a viable alternative to React or Vue and the reasons I found it easier to get started with it. Lots of people criticized that piece, as it was opinionated and didn’t give the other frameworks a proper chance to shine. So, in this article, I’m going to try to compare these three frameworks as objectively as possible, by providing some minimal examples to showcase their capabilities.

**Out of Depth with Flutter**

**Building a real-time user action counting system for ads**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/building-a-real-time-user-action-counting-system-for-ads-88a60d9c9a  
The Pinterest ads team’s mission is to provide the best experience for both Pinners and advertisers. Our ads system is a real-time bidding system that delivers targeted ads based on a variety of attributes. One of the major behavioral attributes is user action counts, the count for a Pinner’s past clicks, impressions and other actions on ads. An important part of user action counts is frequency control, which sets a maximum number of times an ad is shown to a Pinner (impression counts over a period of time enforce this limit).

**XARs: An efficient system for self-contained executables**  
https://code.fb.com/data-infrastructure/xars-a-more-efficient-open-source-system-for-self-contained-executables/  
XARs can be used to deploy Python virtual environments, bundle Node.js applications, and even Lua tools. This can result in efficiency wins from lowered overhead for many types of Python tools, reduced size of the binaries deployed, and offer a more reliable production environment for Python tooling. 另附：[Talk the Walk: Teaching AI systems to navigate New York through language](https://code.fb.com/ai-research/talk-the-walk-teaching-ai-systems-to-navigate-new-york-through-language/).  

**Event Sourcing in Action with eBay's Continuous Delivery Team**

https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/event-sourcing-in-action-with-ebays-continuous-delivery-team/  
Using an Event-centric approach has enabled our team at eBay to scale to handle millions of events with the resiliency to recover from failures as quickly and reliably as possible. Though similar approaches have been widely adopted to augment large-scale data applications, for eBay's Continuous Delivery team, Event Sourcing is at the heart of decision-making and application development. To that end, we've built a system that continuously scales and tests our ability to handle an increasing volume of events and an ever growing list of external data sources and partner integrations.

**Simple, correct, fast: in that order**  
https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html  
The single most important quality in a piece of software is simplicity. It’s more important than doing the task you set out to achieve. It’s more important than performance. The reason is straightforward: if your solution is not simple, it will not be correct or fast.

**Google Cloud Platform - The Good, Bad, and Ugly (It's Mostly Good)**  
https://www.deps.co/blog/google-cloud-platform-good-bad-ugly/  
A note up front, these are solely my experiences, and it’s quite possible that I’ve misunderstood or misrepresented things here. If I’ve made any mistakes, let me know so I can correct them. I only talk about services that I have experience using. There are a bunch of really good looking services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Google App Engine, and BigQuery, but I haven’t used them enough (or at all) to be able to give a review on them.

**Bringing GraphQL to Octokit.NET**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-07-13-graphql-for-octokit/  
If you’ve built apps that connect with GitHub, you are no doubt familiar with Octokit. GitHub offers three official flavors of the easy-to-use Octokit library—one for Ruby, .NET, and Node.js—that work with the GitHub REST API v3. Back in September of 2016, we announced that we would move to GraphQL, the query language developed by Facebook, in part due to the ability to fetch all of the data we wanted in a single request. As a result, the GitHub API v4 is built on GraphQL instead of REST. 另附:[Release Radar · June 2018](https://blog.github.com/2018-07-09-release-radar-june-2018/)、[Supercharging the Git Commit Graph III: Generations and Graph Algorithms](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/07/09/supercharging-the-git-commit-graph-iii-generations/).

**Design Systems at GitHub**  
https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542  
Design systems have become core to the way we design and build at GitHub. Since 2011 GitHub designers have documented UI patterns and shared common styles. In 2012, CSS and other assets were packaged up into a Ruby Gem for use in GitHub websites — this package was named Primer. Primer continued to be used internally for years before eventually having its CSS and accompanying documentation open-sourced as Primer CSS. In 2016 the design systems team was formed with its first full-time employees. This post shares a brief history of how the team grew, what we’ve been working on, and what’s next.

https://mackuba.eu/2018/07/04/dark-side-mac-1/  
This eventually grew into the longest article on this blog, so instead of deleting some sections, I’ve decided to split it into two parts. This first part will be a bit more theoretical about some underlying features and APIs that make the dark mode work or that are especially relevant now, and the second part will be about the things you need to think about while updating the app (and in the future).

There are of course a lot more principles that we should use, but the problem is that a lot of us still don’t use these. And it mainly happens because we prioritise tasks and goals that are not important to our customers. We should always strive to find the right balance that works for our product and users. 另附：[15 Simple Habits That Will Help You Become a Better UX Designer
