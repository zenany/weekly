**Node v8.10.0 (LTS)**  
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.10.0/  
This release comes with a lot of big changes. There are updates to V8, libuv, and ICU, a bugfix in npm, and support for building with OpenSSL 1.1.0. 另附：[Introducing `npm ci` for faster, more reliable builds](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable)、[Strategic Initiatives from the Node.js Project](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/strategic-initiatives-coming-from-the-node-js-project-56a645d53c78).

**What I Talk About When I Talk About Platforms**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html  
Why an effective digital platform can help you scale delivery, what it should have in it, and how to get started building one. These days everyone is building a 'platform' to speed up delivery of digital products at scale. But what makes an effective digital platform? Some organisations stumble when they attempt to build on top of their existing shared services without first addressing their organisational structure and operation model. 另附：[The Agile Fluency Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html)

**Data visualization with react-vis**  
https://medium.com/@shyianovska/data-visualization-with-react-vis-bd2587fe1660  
[React-vis is](http://uber.github.io/react-vis/) a React visualization library created by Uber. With it you can easily create common charts, such as line, area, bar charts, pie and donut charts, tree maps and many more. React-vis is a good option because it is: Simple Flexible Integrated with React. In this article I want to show how to build a simple line chart using react-vis.

**Server Rendering with React and React Router**  
https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-server-rendering/  
Server side rendering a React app can provide a few different benefits including performance and SEO. The problem is with those benefits comes a cost of additional complexity to your application. In this post, we’ll start from scratch and slowly build a server side rendered React (with React Router) while breaking down some of the complexity as we go.

**How I built super fast JS framework**  
https://medium.com/@marcisbee/how-i-built-super-fast-js-framework-faster-than-react-ea99f0d03150  
First of all I want to address elephant in the room that is one question you might be having: “Why the heck another JavaScript framework ?”. Well my answer is that I noticed a pattern in all of the frameworks I recently went through and all of them have the same problem. They are stuck in creating Virtual DOM and then running diffing algorithm over it, which led to diffing algorithm wars. And I thought that there is a better way of doing this (sneaking around this war), so I created a tiny JS Framework called [Radi.js](https://radi.js.org/).

**危险的 target="_blank" 与 “opener”**  
https://knownsec-fed.com/2018-03-01-wei-xian-de-targetblank-yu-opener/  
在网页中使用链接时，如果想要让浏览器自动在新的标签页打开指定的地址，通常的做法就是在 a 标签上添加 target等于"_blank" 属性。然而，就是这个属性，为钓鱼攻击者带来了可乘之机。

**We Write CSS Like We Did in the 90s, and Yes, It’s Silly**  
http://alistapart.com/article/we-write-css-like-we-did-in-the-90s-and-yes-its-silly  
As web developers, we marvel at technology. We enjoy the many tools that help with our work: multipurpose editors, frameworks, libraries, polyfills and shims, content management systems, preprocessors, build and deployment tools, development consoles, production monitors—the list goes on.

**CSS in the Age of React: How We Traded the Cascade for Consistency**  
https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2018/03/css-in-the-age-of-react.html  
In a React world, we’re able to package together JSX with the styling it requires. Our React components explicitly declare dependencies on the CSS they need, which means that we can statically extract all the styles needed on a page so our developers no longer have to manually ensure that the CSS their components need is included!

**How to Write CSS That Works in Every Browser, Even the Old Ones**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/how-to-write-css-that-works-in-every-browser-even-the-old-ones/  
Let me walk you through how exactly to write CSS that works in every browser at the same time, even the old ones. By using these techniques, you can start using the latest and greatest CSS today — including CSS Grid — without leaving any of your users behind. Along the way, you’ll learn the advanced features of Can I Use, how to do vertical centering in two lines of code, the secrets to mastering Feature Queries, and much more. 另附：[Lesser known CSS quirks & advanced tips](https://medium.com/@peedutuisk/lesser-known-css-quirks-oddities-and-advanced-tips-css-is-awesome-8ee3d16295bb)

**Using srcset and sizes to make responsive HTML5 images**  
https://engineering.tumblr.com/post/171593053597/using-srcset-and-sizes-to-make-responsive-html5  
If you’ve tried to implement responsive retina images on the web, you’ve probably come across one of the many informative articles on the subject. Many of the posts I found about it are really great, but they downplay or overlook a point that I think is really important: If you set up srcset and sizes, your browser will automatically download higher density images on retina devices, if they are available. Let’s investigate how to do that.

**CSS Techniques and Effects for Knockout Text**  
https://css-tricks.com/css-techniques-and-effects-for-knockout-text/  
Knockout text is a technique where words are clipped out of an element and reveal the background. In other words, you only see the background because the letters are knocking out holes. It’s appealing because it opens up typographic styles that we don’t get out of traditional CSS properties, like color. 另附：[What Houdini Means for Animating Transforms](https://css-tricks.com/what-houdini-means-for-animating-transforms/)、[Is Houdini Ready Yet](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/)

**Reflected XSS explained: how to prevent reflected XSS in your app**  
https://blog.sqreen.io/reflected-xss/  
A reflected XSS (or also called a non-persistent XSS attack) is a specific type of XSS whose malicious script bounces off of another website to the victim’s browser. It is passed in the query, typically, in the URL. It makes exploitation as easy as tricking a user to click on a link.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/building-a-serverless-real-time-chat-application-with-aws-appsync/  
AWS AppSync, introduced at re:Invent 2017, is a fully managed GraphQL service. It makes it easy to build collaborative mobile and web applications that deliver responsive user experiences, and provide offline and real-time capabilities. Today, we’re introducing ChatQL, which is a new Angular Progressive Web App (PWA) starter application. Built with AWS AppSync, it showcases how to create a real-time chat application.

**Secure Access to 100 AWS Accounts**  
https://segment.com/blog/secure-access-to-100-aws-accounts/  
Segment began in a single AWS account and last year finished our move to a dev, stage, prod, and “ops” accounts. For the past few months we’ve been growing at about one new AWS account every week or two, and plan to continue this expansion in to per-team and per-system accounts. Having many “micro-accounts” provides superior security isolation between systems, and reliability benefits by limiting the blast radius of AWS rate-limits.

**HTTP Analytics for 6M requests per second using ClickHouse**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-analytics-for-6m-requests-per-second-using-clickhouse/  
In this blog post I'm going to talk about the exciting evolution of the Cloudflare analytics pipeline over the last year. I'll start with a description of the old pipeline and the challenges that we experienced with it. Then, I'll describe how we leveraged ClickHouse to form the basis of a new and improved pipeline. In the process, I'll share details about how we went about schema design and performance tuning for ClickHouse. Finally, I'll look forward to what the Data team is thinking of providing in the future.

This article will explain sine, cosine, vectors, atan2, and some useful special effects such as how to make homing missiles and how bitmap rotation works. I shall start with the very basics, but later on I'll cover some more advanced programming techniques. 

**The Future Of Mobile Web Design: Video Game Design And Storytelling**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/future-mobile-web-design-video-game-design-storytelling/  
As attention spans shorten and visitors just want to get to the good stuff on a website, designers have to get more creative in how they communicate their website’s “story.” Ideally, your web design will do more showing of that story instead of telling, which is how video game design tends to succeed in this matter.
