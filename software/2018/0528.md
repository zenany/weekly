**React v16.4.0: Pointer Events**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/05/23/react-v-16-4.html  
The latest minor release adds support for an oft-requested feature: pointer events! It also includes a bugfix for getDerivedStateFromProps. 另附：[All Things React](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/all-things-react)、[Yarn - Ease the Transition to a Monorepo with Focused Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/05/18/focused-workspaces/).

**Introducing Fuse for Cross-Platform App Development**  
https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/introducing-fuse-for-cross-platform-app-development--cms-30793  
Fuse is a platform for developing cross-platform apps with [UX Markup](https://docs.fusetools.com/ux-markup/ux-markup.html) and JavaScript. It's in the same category as React Native and NativeScript, but its main selling point is in the provision of tools that enable developers and designers collaborate in real time. Fuse uses UX Markup, an XML-based language which provides the building blocks for the UI. It also allows you to specify how the different components would behave when users interact with them, thus the name "UX".

**Serverless Architectures**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html

**Getting Started With CSS Layout**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/  
This guide is for you if you are fairly new to CSS and wondering what the best way to approach layout is, but also if you are an experienced developer from elsewhere in the stack who wants to make sure your understanding of layout today is up to date. I have not tried to fully document each layout method here, as that would have created a book and not an article. Instead, I am giving an overview of what is available to you, with plenty of links to find out more.

**Open-sourcing Katran, a scalable network load balancer**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1906146702752923/open-sourcing-katran-a-scalable-network-load-balancer/  
We are open-sourcing a component of this work by releasing the Katran forwarding plane software library, which powers the network load balancer used in Facebook's infrastructure. Katran offers a software-based solution to load balancing with a completely reengineered forwarding plane that takes advantage of two recent innovations in kernel engineering: eXpress Data Path (XDP) and the eBPF virtual machine. Katran is deployed today on backend servers in Facebook’s points of presence (PoPs), and it has helped us improve the performance and scalability of network load balancing and reduce inefficiencies such as busy loops when there are no incoming packets.

**Generating Personalized Content Notifications in Near-Real-Time**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/05/concourse--generating-personalized-content-notifications-in-near  
Social media are computer-mediated platforms that facilitate creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. In the last few years, notifications have been proven to be the mainstay for surfacing social media’s value to users and engaging members. Before the advent of notifications, these social media applications relied on a member’s intent for site visits and discovering information, without any prompting by the network.

**Centrifuge: a reliable system for delivering billions of events per day**

**给前端工程师讲设计终篇**  
https://techblog.toutiao.com/2018/05/24/untitled-19/  
我们对事物的认知，即取决于视网膜上的图像，又受头脑中已有知识结构的影响。当工程师们以自己的经验为中心去看设计时，偏见已经产生了，如果你不理解毕加索作画的整个流程，那么你可能上来就会嘲笑它不过是幼童的涂鸦之作。

**36 Days Of Type - Experience, lessons learnt and take aways**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/https-medium-com-arvindlife-36-days-of-type-bd6e8231649b  
36 days of type is a design challenge where designers are challenged to design a letter or number each day, resulting an outcome of the ability to represent the same symbol from many different perspectives. So, here is my experience and lessons that I have learnt in these 36 days.

**Everything you need to know about Design Systems**  
https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969

**Orchestrating Experiences**  
http://uxmag.com/articles/orchestrating-experiences  
If you embrace the recommended collaborative approaches in your sense-making activities, you and your colleagues should build good momentum toward creating better and valuable end-to-end experiences. In fact, the urge to jump into solution mode will be tempting. Take a deep breath: you have a little more work to do. To ensure that your new insights translate into the right actions, you must collectively define what is good and hold one another accountable for aligning with it.

**How Stack Overflow for Teams Fits into the Community**  
https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/05/23/how-stack-overflow-for-teams-fits-into-the-community/  
Stack Overflow for Teams promise to be a real boon for companies that sign up. But if you aren’t on a Team just now, they are pretty much invisible to you. In the long run, it certainly doesn’t hurt that they provide some extra revenue for more developers, designers and community managers.

**Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions**  
https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/  
How do you think the most rational people in the world operate their minds? How do they make better decisions? They do it by mentally filing away a massive, but finite amount of fundamental, unchanging knowledge that can be used in evaluating the infinite number of unique scenarios which show up in the real world. That is how consistently rational and effective thinking is done, and if we want to learn how to think properly ourselves, we need to figure out how it's done. Fortunately, there is a way, and it works.

**Bias on the Web**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228035-bias-on-the-web/fulltext  
Our inherent human tendency of favoring one thing or opinion over another is reflected in every aspect of our lives, creating both latent and overt biases toward everything we see, hear, and do. Any remedy for bias must start with awareness that bias exists; for example, most mature societies raise awareness of social bias through affirmative-action programs, and, while awareness alone does not completely alleviate the problem, it helps guide us toward a solution. Bias on the Web reflects both societal and internal biases within ourselves, emerging in subtler ways. This article aims to increase awareness of the potential effects imposed on us all through bias present in Web use and content. We must thus consider and account for it in the design of Web systems that truly address people's needs.

**The Bill Gates Line**  
https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/  
The broader takeaway is that distinguishing between platforms and aggregators isn’t simply an academic exercise: it should affect how companies think about their competitive environment vis-à-vis the biggest companies in tech, and, just as importantly, it should weigh heavily on regulators. The Microsoft antitrust battles of the 2000s were in many respects about enforcing interoperability as a way of breaking into the Microsoft platform; today antitrust should be far more concerned about aggregators capturing everything they touch by virtue of their control of end users.

一直以来，大家思考的都是如何增进自己的专业技能，思维技巧等，给自己做加法。做减法同样重要。孟子曾说过：“人有不为也，而后可以有为。”意思是人在特定的阶段下，要知道什么是不能去做的，这样才可以做更重要的事情。这种思想叫做：战略性放弃。另附：[硅谷最伟大的一次失败](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyMDQ5NzI5Mg==&mid=2247496009&idx=1&sn=39d48a178de9e519759bd7065785ecd5)
