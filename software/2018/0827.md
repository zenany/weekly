**Liftoff: a new baseline compiler for WebAssembly in V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/08/liftoff.html  
V8 v6.9 includes Liftoff, a new baseline compiler for WebAssembly. Liftoff is now enabled by default on desktop systems. This article details the motivation to add another compilation tier and describes the implementation and performance of Liftoff.

**Web Performance Made Easy: Google I/O 2018 edition**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/web-performance-made-easy  
We've been pretty busy over the past year trying to figure out how to make the Web faster and more performant. This led to new tools, approaches and libraries that we’d like share with you in this article. In the first part, we’ll show you some optimization techniques we used in practice when developing The Oodles Theater app. In the second part, we’ll talk about our experiments with predictive loading and the new [Guess.js](https://github.com/guess-js/guess) initiative. 另附：[Custom site performance reports with the CrUX Dashboard](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/chrome-ux-report-dashboard).

**Internet Native Applications**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-native-applications/  
No single technology defines Internet Native Applications. However, I believe the combination of: A rapidly increasing percentage of requests serviced directly from the Edge under 10ms; Near-native speed code on the browser, powered by WebAssembly; Improved Internet protocols like QUIC and HTTP/2. 另附：[How Cloudflare protects customers from cache poisoning](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cache-poisoning-protection/)

**Implementing single file Web Components**  
https://medium.com/content-uneditable/implementing-single-file-web-components-22adeaa0cd17  
Probably everyone who knows the Vue framework also heard about its single file components. This super simple idea allows web developers to define the entire code of a component in one file. It’s such a useful solution that an initiative to include this mechanism in browsers has already appeared. However, it seems quite dead as, unfortunately, no progress has been made since August 2017. Nevertheless, looking into this topic and trying to make single file components work in the browsers using the technologies already available was interesting enough to write an article about it!

**Apps That Work Natively on the Web and Mobile**  
https://blog.angular.io/apps-that-work-natively-on-the-web-and-mobile-9b26852495e7  
We’re happy to announce an exciting new way to build web and mobile apps with Angular and NativeScript. First, some background: since the beginning of Angular, you could use NativeScript with Angular to build mobile apps.

**深入理解JSCore**  
https://tech.meituan.com/deep_understanding_of_jscore.html  
动态化作为移动客户端技术的一个重要分支，一直是业界积极探索的方向。目前业界流行的动态化方案，如Facebook的React Native，阿里巴巴的Weex都采用了前端系的DSL方案，而它们在iOS系统上能够顺利的运行，都离不开一个背后的功臣：JavaScriptCore（以下简称JSCore），它建立起了Objective-C（以下简称OC）和JavaScript（以下简称JS）两门语言之间沟通的桥梁。无论是这些流行的动态化方案，还是WebView Hybrid方案，亦或是之前广泛流行的JSPatch，JSCore都在其中发挥了举足轻重的作用。作为一名iOS开发工程师，了解JSCore已经逐渐成为了必备技能之一。另附：[WMRouter：美团外卖Android开源路由框架](https://tech.meituan.com/meituan_waimai_android_open_source_routing_framework.html)

**唯品会的Service Mesh三年进化史**  
http://calvin1978.blogcn.com/?p=1779  
唯品会的服务化体系OSP(Open Service Platform) 在三年前就走上了ServiceMesh的路，每种架构风格，由于各司不同的历史因果，现实状况，以及对采纳新架构的诉求和希望，都会有不同的实现路线。我们的SM在实战中一点点演化而来，与 Istio由谷歌IBM的超级架构师们画出来的架构也有不同之处。希望通过分享我们的演进过程，能给各司里同样在往SM演进中的架构师们一个参考。

**WebAssembly vs. the world. Should you use WebAssembly?**  
https://blog.sqreen.io/webassembly-performance/  
WebAssembly is known for its speed capabilities and this article will put it to the test to better understand what are the best applications to start using WebAssembly today. We will compare the performance of WebAssembly with C/C++, Rust, and TypeScript. Will WebAssembly kill JavaScript? Maybe not just yet. 另附：[Windows 2000 in the Browser via WebAssembly](https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=https://bellard.org/jslinux/win2k.cfg&mem=192&graphic=1&w=1024&h=768)、[Windows 95 in Electron](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows95).

**Advanced effects with CSS background blend modes**  
https://blog.logrocket.com/advanced-effects-with-css-background-blend-modes-4b750198522a  
This article will focus on background-blend-mode, the property with the most widespread support, and how you can use it today to create eye-catching backgrounds and photo effects for your website that once were only possible in Photoshop.

**Async data loading in React**  
https://medium.com/@ghengeveld/async-data-loading-in-react-94661e23cd3d  
The common place to perform data fetching in a React component is in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Just run fetch and use setState to store the result. This is simple enough (and very effective) but leaves a lot to be desired. What about showing some sort of loading indicator? What about error handling? In practice you’ll want to enhance your fetch with a bunch of metadata. You should also consider promise cancellation on unmount, as well as deal with race conditions between consecutive fetches (FiFo).

**Behind the scenes of my latest book on JavaScript**  
http://2ality.com/2018/08/impatient-js.html  
This blog post takes you behind the scenes of my latest book, “JavaScript for impatient programmers” (which I’ll henceforth abbreviate as “Impatient JS”). It describes: How I chose what to write about; My techniques for explaining topics; Tools I used for creating ebooks and other artifacts; How I unit-tested the code shown in the book and in its quizzes.

**Web Reading Mode: The non-standard rendering mode**  
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/browser-reading-mode-parsers  
All the leading web browsers, except for Google Chrome, include a separate “reading mode” that extracts the main content from pages, reformats it to be more readable, and hides distractions like advertisements, comments, and even page navigation. This separate rendering mode isn’t governed by any standards and as such it behave differently from web browser to web browser. So what is a web developer to do to properly support this distinctly separate and non-standard rendering mode? This article is part one in a series on web reading mode and reading mode parsers. The article is broken up into multiple parts as each part is written for a slightly different audience.

**Small Assets without the Headache**  
https://elm-lang.org/blog/small-assets-without-the-headache  
If you want faster page loads, you want smaller assets. But it feels quite complicated to get small assets with JavaScript. Should I switch from React to Preact? Do I have tree shaking set up properly? Will my dependencies even work with tree shaking? Do I need to do something special with my dependencies now? And will code splitting help as well? How does that work? It feels overwhelming even talking about it! Elm 0.19 makes our assets really small without the headache. A bunch of projects have implemented this “RealWorld App” that is a decent size application.

**GraphQL Server Tutorial with Apollo Server and Express**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/graphql-apollo-server-tutorial/  
In the following, you are going to implement the server-side of such architecture by using GraphQL and Apollo Server. Whereas GraphQL is only the query language which got implemented as reference implementation in JavaScript by Facebook, Apollo Server builds up on top of it to simplify building GraphQL servers in JavaScript. 另附：[graphqurl - curl for GraphQL](https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl)

**First steps with TensorFlow.js**  
https://aralroca.com/2018/08/24/first-steps-with-tensorflow-js/  
Nevertheless, we don’t need a deep knowledge about machine learning to use some existing models. We can use some libraries like Keras, Tensorflow or TensorFlow.js. We are going to see here how to create basic AI models and use more sophisticated models with TensorFlow.js. Although it’s not required a deep knowledge, we are going to explain few concepts.

**Serverless Best Practices**  
https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/serverless-best-practices-b3c97d551535  
And remember that best practices are not “the only practices”. Best practices rely on a set of underlying assumptions. If those assumptions don’t fit your use case, then those best practices may not fit. 另附：[Why Serverless Is Being Adopted at a Faster Rate than Expected](https://thenewstack.io/why-serverless-is-being-adopted-at-a-faster-rate-than-expected/)、[Jolie - The first language for Microservices](https://www.jolie-lang.org/)、[Microservices From a Startup Perspective](https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-startup).

**How to extract a data-rich service from a monolith**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/extract-data-rich-service.html  
When breaking monoliths into smaller services, the hardest part is actually breaking up the data that lives in the database of the monolith. In this article, I will be talking about a pattern, which is a series of steps, for extracting a data-rich service from a monolith while causing minimum disruption to the service consumers.

**Coding with Clarity: Part II**  
https://alistapart.com/article/coding-with-clarity-part-ii  
As any developer who works with other developers can attest, if code is unclear, problems occur. In [Part I](https://alistapart.com/article/coding-with-clarity) of this series, I went over some principles to improve clarity in our code to prevent problems that can arise from unclear code. As our apps get larger, clarity becomes even more important, and we need to take extra care to ensure that our code is easy to read, understand, and modify or extend. This article discusses some more-advanced principles related to object-oriented programming (OOP) to improve clarity in larger apps.

**The Future of Notebooks: Lessons from JupyterCon**  
http://willcrichton.net/notes/lessons-from-jupytercon/  
Over the last two days at [JupyterCon](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny), I saw a lot of exciting ideas about the future of Jupyter notebooks. I’ve already written about my own ideas—Jupyter for debugging, Jupyter for prototyping interactions—but in this note, I want to highlight the major trends I saw in the JupyterCon presentations. 另附：[Highlights from JupyterCon](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/highlights-from-jupytercon-ny-2018)、[Scheduling Notebooks at Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6).

**前馈：让功能找到用户；让用户体验美好「自然交互 1」**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41952711  
在人机交互过程中，如何促使人和机/系统在合适场景、合适时间和合适用户上发生交互，是非常重要的课题。但当下数字设备的人机交互中，却存在很大的矛盾，主要来源于以下两点：在物理世界中，一个设备所拥有的功能是存在一定物理极限的，像瑞士军刀一样具备几十种功能的产品已是特例；在数字世界中，功能增长却没有明确的天花板，再加上能无缝访问互联网的设备，基本提供无限多的功能，例如：打开支付宝，享受成千上万种服务；与 50 年前相比，在如今信息爆炸的时代，人们每天接触的信息量早已跃升好几个量级，然而我们的认知能力却与 50 年前无异，甚至和几百年前的人类没有本质差异。
所以，人类认知进化的龟速，远远跟不上信息爆炸的光速。前馈：以设计的方式解决这对日益严重的矛盾，通过自然的人机交互，改变以往「让用户找到功能」的老路，我们探索「让功能找到用户」的新路。
