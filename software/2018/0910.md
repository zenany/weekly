**Removing jQuery from GitHub.com frontend**  
https://githubengineering.com/removing-jquery-from-github-frontend/  
We have recently completed a milestone where we were able to drop jQuery as a dependency of the frontend code for GitHub.com. This marks the end of a gradual, years-long transition of increasingly decoupling from jQuery until we were able to completely remove the library. In this post, we will explain a bit of history of how we started depending on jQuery in the first place, how we realized when it was no longer needed, and point out that—instead of replacing it with another library or framework—we were able to achieve everything that we needed using standard browser APIs.

**Migrating from Underscore to Lodash**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/migrating-from-underscore-to-lodash/  
Over the past two years we’ve worked to modernize our front-end stack. We’ve successfully moved from CoffeeScript to TypeScript, from jQuery to React, and from a custom Flux implementation to Redux. Having completed these migrations we identified our utility library, Underscore, as one more candidate for migration.

**TypeScript at Google**  
http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/09/typescript-at-google.html  
Within Google TypeScript is now found in varying quantities everywhere; it's likely if you use Google products you've interacted with some TypeScript code. TypeScript itself is a bunch of interesting compromises, balancing a statically typed programming language against the free-wheeling JavaScript ecosystem. 另附：[TypeScript with Babel: A Beautiful Marriage](https://medium.com/dailyjs/typescript-babel-ce24f724398)

**公司为什么需要建立一套统一的开发框架**

在公司发展初期，为了快速的进行业务拓展，大都不考虑成本投入，运营维护以及技术沉淀等问题。所有的指标导向都是业务的快速发展，尽可能的抢占市场份额，获取足够多的用户数量。在公司发展到一定阶段后，市场逐渐趋于稳定，先期快速扩展的各种问题会逐步暴露出来。从技术层面来讲，如果可以形成公司级别的统一开发框架，会在实际的生产过程中带来非常大的收益。

**Going International at the Front-End - Simple React i18n**  
https://blog.daftcode.pl/going-international-at-the-front-end-13983cee429d  
Internationalization (i18n) is as old as the Internet, but in the fast changing world we are moving from the “web pages” generated by the server-side, to “single page applications”. This is great in so many ways, but often we find ourselves rediscovering the wheel. In some cases, server-side solutions are easily transferable to the client, but sometimes it’s not that simple and there are additional things to consider.

**Who left open the cookie jar? A comprehensive evaluation of third-party cookie policies**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/09/05/who-left-open-the-cookie-jar-a-comprehensive-evaluation-of-third-party-cookie-policies/  
This paper won a ‘Distinguished paper’ award at USENIX Security 2018, as well as the 2018 Internet Defense Prize. It’s an evaluation of the defense mechanisms built into browsers (and via extensions / add-ons) that seek to protect against user tracking and cross-site attacks. Testing across 7 browsers and 46 browser extensions, the authors find that for virtually every browser and extension combination there is a way to bypass the intended security policies. 另附：[All You Need to Know About Cookies - Cookiepedia](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/).

**Forecasting at Uber: An Introduction**  
https://eng.uber.com/forecasting-introduction/  
This article is the first in a series dedicated to explaining how Uber leverages forecasting to build better products and services. In recent years, machine learning, deep learning, and probabilistic programming have shown great promise in generating accurate forecasts. In addition to standard statistical algorithms, Uber builds forecasting solutions using these three techniques. Below, we discuss the critical components of forecasting we use, popular methodologies, backtesting, and prediction intervals.

**Py-Spy: A sampling profiler for Python programs**  
https://github.com/benfred/py-spy  
Py-Spy is a sampling profiler for Python programs. It lets you visualize what your Python program is spending time on without restarting the program or modifying the code in any way. Py-Spy is extremely low overhead: it is written in Rust for speed and doesn't run in the same process as the profiled Python program, nor does it interrupt the running program in any way. This means Py-Spy is safe to use against production Python code.
