**Incident report: npm, Inc. operations incident of January 6, 2018**  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/169582189317/incident-report-npm-inc-operations-incident-of  
On Saturday, January 6, 2018, we incorrectly removed the user floatdrop and blocked the discovery and download of all 102 of their packages on the public npm Registry. Some of those packages were highly depended on, such as require-from-string, and removal disrupted many users’ installations.

**从前端技术到体验科技**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32782686  
来自玉伯的分享：体验科技，是技术与设计的融合，是服务与用户连接。体验科技是 UX = f(services) 这个公式，能将各种各种的 services（后端服务） 通过技术与设计的融合，转变成体验一流的用户产品。

**如何有效地写算法题**  
http://www.cnblogs.com/sskyy/p/8268976.html  
这篇文章最早发在我团队的文档中。我的团队鼓励每个同学都在业余时间多做算法题，特别是新人。个人认为在编程能力的提升上比做 side project 更有用，对职业发展也是如此。

**虽然难用，但12306面临的业务场景复杂度可能是世界之最**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2651000407&idx=1&sn=6aeda43f3f5fea36ed6cb513f306746d

**How We Architected the New Relic Mobile Web UI in React**  
https://blog.newrelic.com/2018/01/03/mobile-ui-react/  
To make it easier for engineers who contribute code to the UI, we’ve created a flexible system, written in React. And since we’ve built this layered architecture from modules, we’ve been able to decouple the different domains of the UI application from each other, thus easing the burdens of contributors. We wanted to share some of the design behind this complex React project because it’s led us to some seriously great outcomes.

**React, Redux and JavaScript Architecture**  
https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2018/react-redux-javascript-architecture/  
This article might seem long-winded. I do want to show you how to write actual React and Redux code. But it will take a while to get there. And there is a reason. Redux is not terribly complicated. But with Redux (like React), understanding why you’d want to use it is much more interesting than how it works. So, though it might take us a little while to get to Redux, I think the journey will be worth it. 另附：[React Router v4: Philosophy and Introduction](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-philosophy-introduction/)

**5 practical tips to finally learn React in 2018**

**Server Rendering, Code Splitting, and Lazy Loading with React Router v4**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/server-rendering-code-splitting-and-lazy-loading-with-react-router-v4-bfe596a6af70  
Historically, Airbnb has been a Rails app. A few years back that started to change, we began using Rails simply as a data layer, and all render logic started migrating into JavaScript in the form of React. In order to maintain server rendering, we created and open sourced Hypernova, a JavaScript Rendering as a Service… service. Taking this a step further, we introduced client side routing and route based code-splitting with React Router v3 as part of our architecture revamp.

In this post, we’ll try to analyze what techniques modern browsers employ to automatically boost performance (without you even knowing it), and we’ll specifically zoom in on the browser networking layer. We’ll provide some ideas on how to help browsers boost the performance of your web apps even more. At the end, we also share some rules of thumb we use when building SessionStack, a lightweight JavaScript application that has to be robust and highly-performant to help users see and reproduce their web app defects real-time.

**Chrome Only? Careful Now**  
https://css-tricks.com/careful-now/  
The web is the best platform to build for and generally heading in a direction that makes that even truer. The easiest way to screw that up is not being careful with standards. 附：[Chrome 终究走上了 IE 6 的老路](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAwODM4MA==&mid=2650693152&idx=1&sn=d229035592724cb12836e04e2cf24993)

**Create Purposeful Information for a More Effective User Experience**  
http://alistapart.com/article/no-more-faqs-create-purposeful-information-for-a-more-effective-user-experi  
Your website should be filled with purposeful content that meets users’ core needs and fulfills your company’s objectives. Do your users and your bottom line a favor and invest in effective user analysis, IA, content strategy, and documentation. Your users will be able to find the information they need, and your brand will be that much more awesome as a result.

These principles, which should sit at the heart of everything we design and build, are critical and will stand the test of time: Visual Grammar; Language and Typography; Narrative Design.

**Golden Ratio. Bring Balance in UI Design**  
https://uxplanet.org/golden-ratio-bring-balance-in-ui-design-765c954f0ff9  
To create an efficient design composition, professionals apply various techniques and methods from the art science as well as the basic mathematical theories. One of the common tools helping to build pleasing design compositions is a mathematical proportion called the golden ratio. In the article, we’ll define the essence of this technique and see how it can be used in design.

Meltdown impacts WebKit because WebKit’s security properties must first be bypassed (via Spectre) before WebKit can be used to mount a Meltdown attack. 另附：[Meltdown, Spectre, and the State of Technology](https://stratechery.com/2018/meltdown-spectre-and-the-state-of-technology/)
