**Writing Native Node.js Modules - Node.js at Scale**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/writing-native-node-js-modules/  
There are times when the performance of JavaScript is not enough, so you have to depend more on native Node.js modules. While native extensions are definitely not a beginner topic, I'd recommend this article for every Node.js developer to get a bit of knowledge on how they work.

**The Most Common XSS Vulnerability in React.js Applications**  
https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0#.x9yhmtww8  
People are often drawn towards using React.js thanks to the benefits of isomorphic (or universal) rendering. That is, the ability to render your single page application on the server-side, send the html to the client and have the client become interactive without having to re-rendering the entire page.

**JavaScript Developers: Watch Your Language**

http://www.lixuejiang.me/2016/11/27/7%E7%A7%8D%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0web%E4%B8%8B%E5%88%92%E7%BA%BF/  
有许多种不同的方式来实现下划线，你也许还记得 [Crafting link underlines on Medium](https://medium.com/design/7c03a9274f9) 这篇文章。Medium也不是想做什么疯狂的事情，他们只是想让他们的文字下面好看一点。这是一条基本的下划线，它大小合适。绝对比浏览器的默认样式好看的多。所以，看上去Medium为了实现这个效果也经历了许多困难。两年后，实现一个好看的下划线依然一样困难

**The magic behind styled-components**  
http://mxstbr.blog/2016/11/styled-components-magic-explained/  
Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier! styled-components is compatible with both React (for web) and ReactNative – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the ReactNative section for more information

**Scoped Selectors for Redux Modules**  
http://www.datchley.name/scoped-selectors-for-redux-modules/  
Namely, the reusability of selectors when using Redux in applications with more complex state and decomposed reducers (using combineReducers() vs a single, top-level reducer). Specifically, I've been trying to determine how to have selectors, defined parallel with their related reducer, that work on both the localized state and the global state.

In the meantime, here’s an overview of some of the interesting new features and improvements introduced in 5.1. Browser support is still lacking for these features but we’ll refer you to at least some browsers which can be used to test each example.

**I made an iPhone game with PhoneGap and I'll never do it again**  
https://bokstuff.com/i-made-an-iphone-game-with-phonegap-and-ill-never-do-it-again/  
I'm never going to develop a webview app again. Not having to learn a new language was great, but it wasn't worth the performance hit and quirks I encountered along the way. The fact that I should be able to easily port this to Android and other platforms is nice too, but I'm sure those platforms are going to have their own quirks and performance problems. If you're thinking about developing a game like this, just do yourself a favor and go native instead. You won't regret it.

**How Font Awesome 5 Became Kickstarter’s Most Funded Software Project**

https://blog.cloudflare.com/hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-of-http-2/  
If you have experienced HTTP/2 for yourself, you are probably aware of the visible performance gains possible with HTTP/2 due to features like stream multiplexing, explicit stream dependencies, and Server Push. This blog post gives an overview of the reasons for the development of HPACK, and the hidden bandwidth and latency benefits it brings.

**Svelte • The magical disappearing UI framework**  
https://svelte.technology/guide  
https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte  
https://svelte.technology/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework/  
If you've ever built a JavaScript application, the chances are you've encountered – or at least heard of – frameworks like React, Angular, Vue and Ractive. Like Svelte, these tools all share a goal of making it easy to build slick interactive user interfaces. But Svelte has a crucial difference: rather than interpreting your application code at run time, your app is converted into ideal JavaScript at build time. That means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, or incur a penalty when your app first loads.

如果完全依赖历史数据中观察到的关系，就预测变化的影响，这是很幼稚的做法；一个切实可行的复杂系统势必是从一个切实可行的简单系统发展而来的；每个软件单位对其他单位应该都只有最少的知识，而且局限于那些与本单位密切相关的单位，每个软件单位应该只与它的朋友说话；不要与陌生人说话；需要最少假设的那个解释应该被选中；大型网络、尤其是社交网络的功效会随着网络规模呈指数级增加；大型网络、尤其是社交网络的功效会随着网络规模呈指数级增加；

认知用户、定义设计的过程总是千头万绪的，各个流程之间也是交叉进行的，商业设计的具体实践中很难真的遵循如此明确的流程。源于对具体设计问题的理解，大致可以将交互设计的过程分成四个步骤：识别需求，模拟场景（define、discover；理清设计机会、定义功能（synthesize、construct）；交互流程与原型图（construct、refine）；反思评估、规范化（refine、reflect）。
