一本介绍 Google Closure 的书，这个重量级的工具被用在 Gmail、Google Docs、Google Map 等重复杂应用，还是挺值得研究的。

Google 翻译的水平真的越来越高了，英文技术文章 Google 翻译后的结果已经可以看懂了。身为码农，请不要再找借口说英文不好看不懂英文文档了。

**Angular 2 vs React: The Ultimate Dance Off**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/angular-2-vs-react-the-ultimate-dance-off-60e7dfbc379c#.bf5ulsw5p  
Most people who follow me know that I personally favor React, but of course I like my decisions to be educated, not based on uninformed bias. Lately, I’ve been exploring Angular 2 in-depth. Here’s how it compares to React in my opinion.

**Why I'm not a React Native Developer**  
https://arielelkin.github.io/articles/why-im-not-a-react-native-developer  
Many people are currently assessing React Native as a platform to develop their next mobile app on. This is no trivial matter. Having spent several months using React Native, I have found that it is neither a platform I would develop in, nor a platform I would recommend the use of. This article proposes to provide a more thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of switching from Swift development to React Native, and will argue against the switch. 回应文：[Why I'm a React Native Developer: a Response to Ariel Elkin](https://codecookbook.co/text/why-im-a-react-native-developer/)

**Security updates for all active release lines, September 2016**

**Modern Functional Programming**  
http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp-part-2  
http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp  
Late last year, I wrote my thoughts on what the architecture of modern functional programs should look like. Since then, I’ve had a chance to read responses, look at equivalent architectures built upon Monad Transformers Library (MTL), and even talk about my recent experiments at LambdaConf 2016. The result is a sequel to my original post, which consists of a newly-minted, tricked-out recommendation for architecting modern functional programs, along with new ways of thinking about the structure of this architecture.

**代码命名：僧敲月下门**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NDM0ODQwMw==&mid=2649827483&idx=1&sn=228be8c6c3448a56f7ecd00e20e3ae1d  
可不要小看源代码结构、类名、方法名、变量名，它们往往体现着你对系统和业务的理解，勾勒出了系统的骨架，也是工程师交流的渠道。一个程序员的代码反映其能力，而一个程序员给代码命名的水准则反映其修为和内涵。

**[译]大型前端项目的架构**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MTA1MjAxMQ==&mid=2651223189&idx=1&sn=dcb163a56164bbc61dfc6784de20c766  
当在开发你的大型应用架构时，很重要的一点是多想远一点，不知是一个月或一年后，可能是更远。我知道很难猜测未来的发展，但还是有一些空间可以想象。文中给出了了三个典型原则：打造大型应用的诀窍不是在打造一型应用，而是将你的应用拆解成许多小的组件，然后再把他们组成你的应用；因为刚开始就无法预知这个应用未来的发展趋势，所以就坦然接受在不知道任合条件的情況下开始你的设计，这个时候你就会花时间在考虑某些关键模块是否会在将来更变上；组件之间的耦合性很高，其可重用性便低，而且很难再设计变更后却不影响到其他组件的运行。

**Methods for Controlling Spacing in Web Typography**  
https://css-tricks.com/methods-controlling-spacing-web-typography/  
Typography on the web is hard! Yes, we do have a ton of control over how type is displayed, rendered and positioned on the screen. But with great power comes great responsibility. At least you now have a few tools at your disposal to respond back to web designers who are stuck on the the precision of typographical design in the browser. 相关文章

**安卓自定义View进阶-事件分发机制原理**  
http://www.gcssloop.com/customview/dispatch-touchevent-theory  
安卓上面的View是树形结构的，View可能会重叠在一起，当我们点击的地方有多个View都可以响应的时候，这个点击事件应该给谁呢？为了解决这一个问题，就有了事件分发机制。View的事件分发机制实际上就是一个非常经典的责任链模式，如果你了解责任链模式，那么事件分发对你来说并不是什么难题，如果你不了解责任链模式，刚好借此机会学习一下啦。
