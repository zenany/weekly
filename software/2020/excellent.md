**Introducing Hummingbard**  
https://hummingbard.com/hummingbard/introducing-hummingbard  
Hummingbard is an experiment in building communities on top of Matrix. Hummingbard has social elements like user profiles, posts, communities, sharing and so on. It is intended to be more than just a decentralized link aggregator or a microblogging platform.

**The web didn't change; you did**  
https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did  
The web really didn't change. It really didn't become complex. The web development process is not one single path. There is simply more choice and more options. We, you and I, the developers, consumers and businesses are responsible for demanding more complicated (and more thorough) tools. We are not, however, beholden to complexity.

**Painting With the Web**  
https://matthiasott.com/notes/painting-with-the-web  
There are a lot of amazing new technologies just around the corner. CSS Houdini with the Paint API, for example, or various other Web APIs like the WebXR Device API for creating augmented or virtual reality experiences or the Web Speech API to design voice user interfaces. If we want to explore and create amazing things with those new technologies, we need to be able to have that creative dialogue with the materials in front of us. And in most cases, this means: We need to work directly in the browser. We need to paint with code.

**FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**  
https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/  
We need a new FrontPage. A FrontPage that uses HTML5 and CSS3 and modern JavaScript and cool PHP stuff. A FrontPage that follows modern design principles like semantic HTML and powerful CSS styling. A FrontPage that is totally open, totally not a pawn in world domination schemes, totally not locked down to one greedy vendor, and totally not abandoned. A FrontPage that outputs usable, sensical, and simple HTML and CSS. A FrontPage that integrates with version control software like Git and planning programs like KPlan and communications programs like email or IRC to allow planned, meaningful collaboration. A FrontPage that lets people write and share useful and versatile WebBots like people do WordPress plugins today. (Probably using JavaScript instead of custom server-side plugins, though.) In summary, we need a FrontPage that lets the incredibly talented common folk retake the internet with creativity and originality. Because as nice as Facebook and Twitter are, let's face it, we all kind of miss the old days of lovably terrible hand-crafted sites.

**Flash Animations Live Forever at the Internet Archive**  
http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/  
Great news for everyone concerned about the Flash end of life planned for end of 2020: The Internet Archive is now emulating Flash animations, games and toys in our software collection. Utilizing an in-development Flash emulator called [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), we have added Flash support to the Internet Archive’s Emularity system, letting a subset of Flash items play in the browser as if you had a Flash plugin installed. While Ruffle’s compatibility with Flash is less than 100%, it will play a very large portion of historical Flash animation in the browser, at both a smooth and accurate rate.

**The Tech Stack of a One-Man SaaS**  
https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/  
Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat. A couple of months ago I started working on yet another private analytics service, a project which has gone through numerous iterations, and I feel lucky that 400+ websites have already integrated with it, even though it's still in the early stages. That’s why, in the same spirit as Jake Lazaroff’s Tools and Services I Use to Run My SaaS, I thought it’s now my turn to do a short write up of the technologies I’m using to run this new service.

**Beyond the Database, and Beyond the Stream Processor: What's the Next Step for Data Management?**  
https://www.infoq.com/articles/whats-the-next-step-for-data-management/  
As companies become more automated, and their business processes become more automated, we end up with many applications talking to one another. This is a humongous shift in system design as it’s about doing the work in a fully automated fashion by machines. We need to rethink what a database is, what it means to us, and how we interact with both the data it contains and the event streams that connect it all together.

**If not SPAs, What?**  
https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html  
A few months ago, I wrote an article about [how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html). The SPA pattern (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks. Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to really dive into the frameworks, but things like walking in parks have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour. If you’re not a fan of the SPA approach, what else can you do? Turns out there are numerous modern alternatives from [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/).

**Think and Develop Serverless Applications as ‘Set-Pieces’**  
https://medium.com/lego-engineering/think-and-develop-serverless-applications-as-set-pieces-4fa36d79ac3f  
Visualize your serverless applications as a collection of set-pieces. Serverless gives us functional and granular level service features. By utilizing these unique characteristics, we can easily shift our thinking from a coarse-grained microservice to fine-grained serverless services. When you start your serverless development, free your mind to go beyond the tradition to bring fresh ideas. New technology requires new thinking. If serverless gives you wings, then make full use of them and accelerate your cloud journey to enter new territories.
Go Build Serverless!

**The Tyranny of Metrics**  
https://nemethgergely.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-metrics  
There seems to be a growing trend in technology--and in all aspects of our lives, really--to measure everything: business outcomes, organizational success, and individual performance. I wrote about engineering productivity and how I disagree with measuring individual performance based on metrics before, so I was excited to start reading [The Tyranny of Metrics](https://nemethgergely.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-metrics) by Jerry Z. Muller. In the book, Muller draws on both Campbell and Goodhart's expertise, then provides more insights on metrics fixation and the detrimental effects they have on our everyday life. Sometimes, the best metric is no metric.

**Svelte for Sites, React for Apps**  
https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/  
Why we should stop trying to use the same tool for different jobs. In 2020, my personal recommendation to web developers is to use Svelte for Sites, and React for Apps. This is, remarkably, a nuanced enough opinion that it pisses off fans of either of them.

**Writing JavaScript tools in other languages – a new trend?**  
https://2ality.com/2020/10/js-plus-other-languages.html  
Recently, we have seen an uptick of JavaScript tools being written in languages other than JavaScript. This blog post lists a few examples and explains the appeal of not using JavaScript. Releated: [Rust meets the web - a clash of programming paradigms](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Rust_on_the_Web.html).

**The Developer Experience Gap**  
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/10/06/developer-experience-gap/  
If there is and can be no Apple-equivalent enterprise vendor arriving to make sure the enterprise telephone app team plays nicely with the enterprise music player team, what progress can be expected? It’s early, and the next few quarters should provide hints at who has accurately identified the depth of the problem and taken steps to address it. In the meantime, here are five adjectives that will describe the next generation of developer experience: Comprehensive, Developer Native, Elegant, Multi-Runtime, Multi-Vendor.

**Good sleep, good learning, good life**

This e-book attempts to produce a synthesis of what is known about sleep with a view to practical applications, esp. in people who need top-quality sleep for their learning or creative achievements. Neurophysiology of sleep is an explosively growing branch of science. Many theories that are currently contested will soon be forgotten as a result of new findings.

**The Widening Responsibility for Front-End Developers**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/  
Front-end development is at the intersection of art and logic. A cross of business and expression. Both left and right brain. A cocktail of design and nerdery. I love it.

**Tools should not only be for experts – they should turn us into them**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2020/09/15/tools-should-not-only-be-for-experts-they-should-turn-us-into-them/  
I think it is high time we moved away from the concept of “tools for experts” towards one of “using this tool over time makes you an expert”. To put it in other words: Our tools should never make people feel “too stupid” to use them or wonder why some features are even there. As an example, let’s take a look at the developer tools bundled with browsers these days. These are excellent. It is wonderful to have all you need to build and test your web products in the tool you use to surf the web. Releated: [Tools should not only be for experts – they should turn us into them](https://christianheilmann.com/2020/09/15/tools-should-not-only-be-for-experts-they-should-turn-us-into-them/).

**Disrespectful Design—Users aren’t stupid or lazy**  
https://somehowmanage.com/2020/09/13/disrespectful-design-users-arent-stupid-or-lazy/  
It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong. The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the Don’t Make Me Think thesis.

**Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools**  
https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244329  
Search for tools that view the world and your work the way your mind does, and prefer tools that can grow with you over time, the way that works best for you. I think it’s in this kind of a harmonious symbiosis between our tools and our minds that we can do great work and imagine our best futures.

**Web History — Chapter 1: Birth**  
https://css-tricks.com/chapter-1-birth/  
Information is the web’s core function. A series of bytes stream across the world and at the end of it is knowledge. The mechanism for this transfer — what we know as the web — was created by the intersection of two things. The first is the Internet, the technology that makes it all possible. The second is hypertext, the concept that grounds its use. They were brought together by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And when he was done he did something truly spectacular. He gave it away to everyone to use for free.

The web is in need of some reinvention right now. The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses. The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.

**Unit Testing is Overrated**  
https://tyrrrz.me/blog/unit-testing-is-overrated  
Unit testing is a popular approach for testing software, but mostly for the wrong reasons. It’s often touted as an effective way for developers to test their code while also enforcing best design practices, however many find it encumbering and superficial. It’s important to understand that development testing does not equate to unit testing. The primary goal is not to write tests which are as isolated as possible, but rather to gain confidence that the code works according to its functional requirements. And there are better ways to achieve that. Writing high-level tests that are driven by user behavior will provide you with much higher return on investment in the long run, and it isn’t as hard as it seems. Find an approach that makes the most sense for your project and stick to it.

**Always bet on HTML – being misunderstood**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2020/07/06/always-bet-on-html-being-misunderstood/  
That said, to me the argument of HTML vs. JavaScript is boring and we’ve spent years running in circles around it. The job we have now is to battle some of the old prejudices against HTML with facts and good examples. Not by telling people off for relying on JavaScript. Often the best way is to ask why they chose to do that. If there is a lack of education or HTML knowledge, we can follow up with good resources. I’m pretty sure the image of the “I don’t care about end users, the only thing I care about is developer convenience” code-Bro isn’t as common as we think it is.

**Just Too Efficient**  
https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient  
Bruce is pointing out that overoptimizing efficiency doesn’t just burn people out, it also too often requires cutting into what you later realize were prudent safety margins. It’s hard to think of a position more radical than being “against efficiency”. And I’m not. Efficiency is a good, and like most good things, has to be bought somehow, and paid for. There is a point where the price is too high, and we’ve passed it.

**What is Developer Experience (DX)?**  
https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/  
Developer Experience¹ is a term² with a self-declaring meaning — the experience of developers — but it eludes definition in the sense that people invoke it at different times for different reasons referring to different things. For instance, our own Sarah Drasner’s current job title is “VP of Developer Experience” at Netlify, so it’s a very real thing. But a job title is just one way the term is used. Let’s dig in a bit and apply it to the different ways people think about and use the term.

For me, I stepped out into an uncertain future. I don’t really see meaningful human interaction anymore. I see a society that is impossibly distracted by likes and selfies, smartphones, and similar technologies, and I often find it frustrating to find my place in the midst of this new interconnected world simply because I was not there to naturally evolve with it. I was somewhere outside of time, on the other side of the looking glass. Waiting. Counting fractions of what felt like forever, for when I would be released back into society again. Only to discover a world I do not know.

**Complexity Has to Live Somewhere**  
https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html  
https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/gardened/  
Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I've seen repeat itself over and over again. It's something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What's the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having "too much magic"? When are there too many languages in an organisation? We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.

When we thought about how we would build a new web app — one designed for today’s browsers, with the features people expect from Facebook — we realized that our existing tech stack wasn’t able to support the app-like feel and performance we needed. A complete rewrite is extremely rare, but in this case, since so much has changed on the web over the course of the past decade, we knew it was the only way we’d be able to achieve our goals for performance and sustainable future growth. Today, we’re sharing the lessons we’ve learned while rearchitecting Facebook.com, using React (a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces) and Relay (a GraphQL client for React).

There is a sweet spot of React: in moderately interactive interfaces. Complex forms that require immediate feedback, UIs that need to move around and react instantly. That’s where it excels.

The high performance parts aren’t React.

We all mourned when Reader died and took RSS with it, but it's time to return to what made it great. A lot of people who were on the internet in the early 2000’s remember something called RSS. It stands for really simple syndication, and it allowed content creators to publish updates to the world in a well-understood format. The idea—which seems strange to type out—is that millions of people in the world could create and publish ideas, thoughts, and content…and then people who enjoyed that content would collect sources into a reader, which was called, well, an RSS Reader.

There is no faster (pun intended) way to slow down a site than to use a bunch of JavaScript. The thing about JavaScript is you end up paying a performance tax no less than four times:

- The memory cost

**Please stop recommending Git Flow!**  
https://georgestocker.com/2020/03/04/please-stop-recommending-git-flow/  
Git-flow is a branching and merging methodology popularized by this blog post, entitled “A Successful Git branching model”. In the last ten years, countless teams have been snookered by the headline and dare I say lied to. If you read the blog post, the author claims they successfully introduced it in their projects, but purposefully doesn’t talk about the project details that made it successful. The end, right? Well, not quite. I can tell a few of you are unconvinced by this line of reasoning, so let’s dig deeper into why the gitflow branching model should die in a fire.

**The History of the URL**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/  
In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis for the web being the hyperlink. It is a method of linking one document to another, which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions, authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create. Ultimately, the conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all that matters is adoption. If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it might be, they will help you craft it into what they need. The corollary is, of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might be. There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which precisely no one uses today.

**Old CSS, new CSS**  
https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/  
I first got into web design/development in the late 90s, and only as I type this sentence do I realize how long ago that was. And boy, it was horrendous. I mean, being able to make stuff and put it online where other people could see it was pretty slick, but we did not have very much to work with. I’ve been taking for granted that most folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date. Some time ago I encountered a tweet marvelling at what we had to do without border-radius. I still remember waiting with bated breath for it to be unprefixed! But then, I suspect I also know a number of folks who only tried web design in the old days, and assume nothing about it has changed since. I’m here to tell all of you to get off my lawn. Here’s a history of CSS and web design, as I remember it.

**What is SAP**

https://retool.com/blog/erp-for-engineers/  
ERP is where companies store their core operational data. We’re talking about sales projections, purchase orders, and inventory, as well as the processes that act upon that data (e.g. paying out vendors when a purchase order is issued). In a sense, ERP is the “brain” of a company — it stores all important pieces of data and all of the actions possible in data-driven workflows. But before taking over the modern business world, how did ERP software get started? The story of ERP begins with major automation efforts of the 1960s: while the 1940s and 50s were focused on mechanical automation of blue collar work — think General Motors establishing their automation department in 1947 — the automation of white collar work (often via the computer!) began in the 1960s.

**Today, the Trident Era Ends**

Starting now, Microsoft will roll out their new Chromium-based Edge browser to their millions of Windows 10 users. And this will also mark the end of an era. The era of the Trident-Engine. Coming back to my introductory part on ancient civilizations and their achievements: For me, it feels like Internet Explorer already had many of the things that we came to reinvent later and that we now celebrate as innovations. Although our modern reinventions offer more features combined with better developer experience, I came to wonder why we, as a community, only picked up very few of them. Looking at the above list, I would say that Microsoft was lightyears ahead of everyone else in regards to providing tools and solutions for architecting complex and delightful websites. Some syntax may look unfamiliar to us, but this is just because we are not used to it.

In [Software Disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) we’ve seen how software has degraded in the past two decades. Recently Jonathan Blow gave a talk where he explained why it might be happening. In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what’s going on down the stack. This is where my contribution begins: I believe I have found some pretty vivid examples of how the ladder of abstractions has started to fall and nobody can do anything about it now because we all are used to work only at the very tip of it.

So I want to call it out: where we are today is bullshit. As engineers, we can, and should, and will do better. We can have better tools, we can build better apps, faster, more predictable, more reliable, using fewer resources (orders of magnitude fewer!). We need to understand deeply what we are doing and why. We need to deliver: reliably, predictably, with topmost quality. We can—and should–take pride in our work. Not just “given what we had…”—no buts!
