**A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture**  
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234352-a-new-golden-age-for-computer-architecture/fulltext  
We have considered two different approaches to improve program performance by improving efficiency in the use of hardware technology: First, by improving the performance of modern high-level languages that are typically interpreted; and second, by building domain-specific architectures that greatly improve performance and efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs. DSLs are another example of how to improve the hardware/software interface that enables architecture innovations like DSAs. Achieving significant gains through such approaches will require a vertically integrated design team that understands applications, domain-specific languages and related compiler technology, computer architecture and organization, and the underlying implementation technology. 

**Browse State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Papers with Code**  
https://paperswithcode.com/sota  
The mission of Papers With Code is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code and evaluation tables. We believe this is best done together with the community and powered by automation. We've already automated the linking of code to papers, and we are now working on automating the extraction of evaluation metrics from papers.  另附：[Using Artificial Intelligence to Generate Alt Text on Images](https://css-tricks.com/using-artificial-intelligence-to-generate-alt-text-on-images/).

**Future JavaScript: what is still missing?**  
http://2ality.com/2019/01/future-js.html  
In recent years, JavaScript has grown considerably in size. This blog post explores what’s still missing. Notes: I’m only listing the missing features that I find most important. Many others are useful, but there is also a risk of adding too much. 另附：[ES2019登场](https://juejin.im/post/5c512592e51d4507786250b6)、[A Year (plus a little) on TC39](https://medium.com/braintree-product-technology/a-year-plus-a-little-on-tc39-a1acb87eb862).

**HTML is and always was a compilation target – can we deal with that?**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2019/01/28/html-is-and-always-was-a-compilation-target-can-we-deal-with-that/  
HTML is well defined. It is also robust, inasmuch that it is forgiving. We tried to make HTML less forgiving in the XHTML days but the web was not in a state to allow for that. Developer mistakes should not result in user lock-out. Instead, browsers should be lenient with HTML and fix things on the fly when rendering. This should worry us, as we are forced to carry with us years of horrible browser decisions. That’s why – amongst other things – browsers are fat and slow.

**Streamlining Frontend-as-a-Service for Backend Teams**  
https://medium.com/walmartlabs/streamlining-frontend-as-a-service-for-backend-teams-69d9223efcec  
We established a Frontend-as-a-Service (FaaS): providing UX Design and UI Development services for more than 5 teams. We ran into many unforeseen challenges in our first few months, but after a few iterations, we were able build a working process to minimize these challenges and uncover the unknowns.

**写给工程师的十条精进原则**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxMzEzMjM5NQ==&mid=2651031315&idx=1&sn=5c046276927ccf8bf0aea784a8d01b60  
8年过去了，自己从一个职场小白逐步成长为一名技术Leader。我发现团队中的很多同学在不停地重复犯着自己当年类似的错误。他们并不是不努力，到底是哪里出了问题？经过一段时间的观察与思考后，我想我找到了答案。那就是：我们大多数同学在工作中缺乏原则的指导。原则，犹如指引行动的“灯塔”，它连接着我们的价值观与行动。不久前，桥水基金创始人雷·达里奥在《原则》一书中所传达的理念，引爆了朋友圈。每个人都应该有自己的原则，当我们需要作出选择时，一定要坚持以原则为中心。但是在现实生活中，我们往往缺少对原则的总结，对于很多人来说这是一门“只可意会不可言传”的玄学，是属于老司机的秘密，其实不然。作为一名技术人员，我们应该如何践行呢？本文总结了十条精进原则，希望能够给大家带来一些启发，更好地指导我们的行动。

**前端tree组件，10000个树节点，从12.19s到0.49s**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/55528376  
全篇主要思想：递归的本质是栈的读取。递归组件也可以转换成扁平数组来实现：1、更改DOM结构成平级结构，点击节点以及节点的视觉样式通过操作总的list数据去实现；2、然后使用虚拟长列表来控制vue子组件实例创建的数量。

**Codemods: Effective, Automated Refactoring**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/codemods-effective-automated-refactoring/  
Maintaining software is challenging. Stagnant software quickly becomes obsolete and this couldn’t be truer than in the JavaScript ecosystem. JavaScript firmly holds the reigns as the language of the web and with that comes a unique opportunity for the language and ecosystem to learn and adopt best practices and paradigms from other languages and ecosystems, as JavaScript is the convergence point for all web projects. This means that everything changes, from the language syntax to the popular patterns used to write effective front-end code.

I am a system administrator, and I need a small, lightweight notebook for every day carrying. Of course, not just to carry it, but for use it to work. After not finding anything suitable, I thought about how a notebook would turn out if it were developed not with design, but the needs of real users in mind. System administrators, for example. Or people serving telecommunications equipment in hard-to-reach places — on roofs, masts, in the woods, literally in the middle of nowhere. The results of my thoughts are presented in this article.
