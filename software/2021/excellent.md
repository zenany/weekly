**The 88x31 GIF Collection: Part 1**  
http://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/  
A collection of 3182 classic 88x31 buttons from the 1990’s, 2000’s, and today in GIF format. I try to update this page regularly. Feel free to copy buttons to your website, but avoid hot-linking if possible.

**Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend**  
https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/how-to-write-disposable-code-in-large-systems  
Every line of code written comes at a price: maintenance. To avoid paying for a lot of code, we build reusable software. The problem with code re-use is that it gets in the way of changing your mind later on.

**Estimating Software Projects**  
https://jacobian.org/series/estimation/  
One major “secret” to advancing in a technical career is learning how to give accurate estimates. It certainly has been for me: I don’t shy away from giving timelines, and I’ve learned how to be right often enough that folks trust my estimates.

**Data Structure Visualizations**  
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html  
The best way to understand complex data structures is to see them in action. We've developed interactive animations for a variety of data structures and algorithms. Our visualization tool is written in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element, and run in just about any modern browser -- including iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad, and even the web browser in the Kindle! (The frame rate is low enough in the Kindle that the visualizations aren't terribly useful, but the tree-based visualizations -- BSTs and AVL Trees -- seem to work well enough). Check the Algorithms menu for all of the latest javascript implementations.

**React Ruined Web Development**  
https://medium.com/building-productive/react-ruined-web-development-dd65342a833f  
You can try to convince me that React isn’t that bad, and I will absolutely agree with you! 😄 But instead, let’s debate about the more important topics — the work that we actually do as software engineers. 

**Why we need to stop using React**  
https://sredmond.medium.com/why-we-need-to-stop-using-react-1ae3ec7959a4  
Before we even get started I can already hear you pounding away at your keyboards writing your angry response. I would ask that you read my full explanation before going off at me in the comments. I really want to emphasize that I’m not trying to attack you personally because you use React or like React. However, what I am trying to say is that I think that React leaves a lot to be desired. What I want to do is explore the pain points and detail why I think React is an overall flawed library.

**I miss the old internet**  
https://www.sffworld.com/forum/threads/i-miss-the-old-internet.57195/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27491537  
Is it just me or is today's internet boring and overly commercialized? I feel like today's internet is like a modern mall, sterile and boring with just main-brand clothing stores, a food court, and not a lot else. Whereas I feel like the old internet was more like an exciting urban playground. First off, yes, I know that the old internet was dial-up and you could get kicked off if someone picked up the phone. I also know it was much slower. I lived through it. I was in middle school when my dad got the internet in the mid 1990s, probably about 1995-96?

**如何从书法篆刻里学设计？让AGI高手何佳兴来教你！**  
https://www.uisdc.com/hejiaxing  
篆刻与书法，这都是我上大学前想都没想过的事情，何佳兴说：其实我大学主修书法与篆刻纯属意外。高中我了解过广告设计，考大学时则想攻读西画，因为西画与设计在感觉上比较贴合。事与愿违，因为分数不够，被分到国画组，但在学习篆隶草行楷等各类字体的过程中，慢慢发现了其中的乐趣所在。书法以线条表现，写字的状态很吸引人，篆刻也是。我觉得艺术创作是可以跨领域互相移植的，我也认为把我学过的书法和当代艺术的逻辑移植到设计上，就会许多交叉运用的可能性。

**做出高大上的书法字排版**  
https://www.uisdc.com/calligraphy-typesetting  
书法艺术是中华民族文化的精髓，是最具民族特色的设计元素之一。经过历史的锤炼，中国的文字至今仍充盈着旺盛生命力和独具一格的艺术魅力。书法艺术的恰当运用，会给人以极高的审美境界，它的感染力是美术字所不能替代的。一些优秀的设计师把书法艺术融汇到现代设计中，这样的设计主题突出，视觉冲击力强，更容易引起消费者的关注。

**软件幻灭**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/100662403  
我们今天所在的地方是糟糕的。作为工程师，我们有能力也应该做得更好。我们应该有更好的工具，我们应该构建更好的应用，更快，更可预测，更可靠，资源消耗更低（低几个数量级！）。我们应该深入理解我们在做什么以及为什么要做。我们可靠、可预测、最高质量的交付。我们有能力也应该为我们的工作感到自豪。我们不应该只是“交付我们已有的。。。“，没有但是！Releated: [Surprisingly Slow](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/06/surprisingly-slow/), [I can only think that modern front end development has failed](https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1378272801522597888) 及相关讨论： https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26689239 

**语义化表达 —— 构建类型优先的交互体系**  
https://www.yuque.com/xufei-coder/code/fhoks9  
近几年，随着 TypeScript 的逐步流行，类型系统逐渐被前端这个群体重视起来，也逐渐在一些组件库中被深度采用。但是，我们可以发现，如果从使用类型系统的几个层级去划分：类型不友好，类型友好，类型优先。几乎所有组件库都处于前两个层级，并未达到类型优先的程度。那么，什么是类型优先，它有什么好处，本文尝试结合一些具体案例，给出说明。

**CSS is a Strongly Typed Language**  
https://css-tricks.com/css-is-a-strongly-typed-language/  
[CSS is a declarative, domain-specific programming language](https://notlaura.com/css-is-a-programming-language/). It is also strongly typed. For the most part, values in CSS stay declared as authored. If a value is invalid the browser throws the entire property away.

**What Saul Bass Can Teach Us About Web Design**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/saul-bass-teach-web-design/  
Film credits, brand logos, posters… Saul Bass did it all, and the principles that informed his work are just as valuable now as they were 50 years ago.

**Organic, Homegrown HTML**  
https://atthis.link/blog/2021/html.html  
Despite increasing leniency on frameworks being the only way to build for the web1, hand-written HTML never disappeared and I feel is still a perfectly suitable way to build a personal website.

**The web is something different**  
https://daverupert.com/2021/02/the-web-is-something-different/  
To be clear, I hate the “The web is for documents” take as much as I hate the “I build web apps, not websites” take as much as the “The web is a compile target” take as much as I hate the “The web has to compete with native apps” take. Those takes always seem to end up as some kind of scaffolding for a pissing contest, an attempt to denigrate someone else’s line of work.

**Complexity Explained**  
https://complexityexplained.github.io/
Complexity science, also called complex systems science, studies how a large collection of components – locally interacting with each other at small scales – can spontaneously self-organize to exhibit non-trivial global structures and behaviors at larger scales, often without external intervention, central authorities or leaders. The properties of the collection may not be understood or predicted from the full knowledge of its constituents alone. Such a collection is called a complex system and it requires new mathematical frameworks and scientific methodologies for its investigation.

**How to hire senior developers: Give them more autonomy**  
https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/autonomy/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26027448  
If we agree with Naur’s assessment of programming, what follows is that the value of a high tech company is inseparably interwoven with the development team, and the model of the problem domain in their heads. What this means, in essence: The main value of a software company is the mapping of source code and problem space in the developer’s heads. This conclusion has important consequences for many aspects of a software company, but especially for management, hiring and overall culture.

**Maximizing Developer Effectiveness**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html  
Technology is constantly becoming smarter and more powerful. I often observe that as these technologies are introduced an organization’s productivity instead of improving has reduced. This is because the technology has increased complexities and cognitive overhead to the developer, reducing their effectiveness. In this article, the first of a series, I introduce a framework for maximizing developer effectiveness. Through research I have identified key developer feedback loops, including micro-feedback loops that developers do 200 times a day. These should be optimized so they are quick, simple and impactful for developers. I will examine how some organizations have used these feedback loops to improve overall effectiveness and productivity.
